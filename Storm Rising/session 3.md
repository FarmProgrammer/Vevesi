## Arrival at Port Royal
As the moat of mist lifts the northern cliffs of port royal and its harbours come into view the sight takes your breath away. The docks are built into the cliffside at various points where nature acts as a wave break for the salty water, the smell of fruit and rum is evident even at 100 feet from shore. Along the cliff you see multiple wooden building like the bows of ships protrude from the cliff making up the brunt of residences, taverns and shops of port royal. But what causes you the most awe, above the sheer cliff of smooth stone is one of the larges buildings you have ever seen, a lighthouse 120 feet across and 360 feet up, its light having illuminated your path.

As the ship docks to you surprise the pier is quickly filled by howling and singing people as they seem eager for your arrival.
## Induction into the Republic
Stepping into the main floor of the lighthouse you find yourselves in something akin to an amphitheatre as the main area of the floor is a large circle, surrounded by raised wooden railings, behind them sit those in charge of some of the most notorious, deadly, efficient or noble pirate crews currently within the sea, opposite the entrance sits [[Marshall Teach]], a man many cannot define, as he seems to have not aged, many theorize him to be some sort of bearded elf but none of those rumours bear any truth or merit,  to his left sits [[Krok Backwater]], whos ship you saw arriving as you did, a lizardfolk who dresses exactly as one would expect a pirate to, many know of him, few know him, he rarely makes port, often remaining at sea for years until  some obligation forces him from his boat, to the left of him sits [[Atop a Rock]], as much a pirate as you are a farmer, and yet no one dares attempt to disqualify his claim at the council, as to incite his wrath is to incite the wrath of every merfolk in [[The Arrow Stones]], even without any plunder to his name none dare to question his prowess, and those who have now find themselves resting upon the bed of the sea. To his left in turn sits Captain [[Pelagie Wayward]], in substitution the once great crew of the [[Sea Dogs]], despite her new arrival her methods have earned a respect from many of the other council members, even from Atop a Rock as she has yet to lose a single crewmate during boarding, behind her sits her first mate, and perhaps more [[Raul Sahiir]]. To the right of [[Marshall Teach]] sits [[Zheng Yi Sao]], a captain from [[Narashihoro]] who truly brought her crew forth after the death of her husband, culminating in the seat she now sits at in the council. To her left sits the ever infamouse [[Claxton Ephraine]], a pirate of such renown it is said that even in the center of the most isolated mountain ranges, miles from the sea, his name is whispered in fear, and yet people know as little of him as they know of the moons that bring night or [[The Eye of Astrid]]. To his left in turn sits [[Aurum]], the ever gleaming captain of the [[Golden Carvers]], nonchalantly sitting in her chair, even by pirate standards, counting a stack of gold coins on her desk, seemingly bored of the meeting before its start. To her Right sit the 2 captains of [[The Drifting Hunters]], [[Adrian Karlsson]] and [[Emily Pembroke]], one with the ever serious stare one expects from a military man while t he other seemingly blowing soap bubbles from nothing. finally to their right sits the ever shifting form of [[Bedario Sabbag]], the warden of storms, with a ship ever shrouded in winds and mist none know the true nature of the ship itsself, it is only known that it has never sunk, and never bothers to fire cannons, as the desert warriors aboard are plenty eager to fight rested fighters.

## Recruiting
### [[Mama Magda]]
At the center of Port Royal's coast lies the great, imposing harbor, where warships and trading galleons dock. To the south is the armada’s shipyard, masts proudly flying the Cape Coral standard. To the north, though, are the docks the humbler vessels call home. Rickety wharfs lined with little fishing-boats give way to long piers, stretching towards the horizon. There is, of course, a pervasive stink of fish, but the smell of rich spices overpowers even that.

You follow your noses to the front of the Fishing Guild, where a middle-aged human stirs a bubbling cauldron filled with enough delicious-smelling fish stew to feed an army. She looks up as you approach, beaming in welcome.

#### ### Encounter: Skill Challenge

Mama Magda is very willing to help, and needs no convincing to stand with Princess Lua. She does need a hand putting her plan together, though. Magda is famed for her never-breaking fishing nets, and she’ll share her secret with the party: they’re made out of Mermaid Hair. No, not the actual hair of actual merfolk, but a thin, wiry substance secreted by a type of crab that lives in the coral reefs close to Cape Coral. With enough Mermaid Hair, Mama Magda could reinforce some of her nets enough to withstand even the Kraken -- and even slow it down. The only problem is that Mermaid Hair Crabs are notoriously difficult to find.

The party must dive into the waters off the shore and look for Mermaid Hair Crabs. Have each of the players make a skill check (base DC 15). They might use a Wisdom (Survival) check to find the crabs’ habitat; a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to find the crabs themselves; or Wisdom (Animal Handling) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to acquire the Mermaid Hair. However, feel free to let your players come up with different strategies and ways to gather the hair! This is a medium-difficulty challenge: they must achieve four successes before they get four failures.
### [[Rayco]]
The harbor is the heart of any port town, and Port Royal is no different. The road from the castle leads straight through the city’s main plaza directly down to the large marina. It’s not nearly as full as it could be; most of the docks -- themselves clearly rebuilt from pieced-together detritus -- stand empty.


The biggest ship currently docked is a battered behemoth of a whaleship. Smoke pours from a furnace behind the mast, and smaller boats swing from its sides. A lone man sits on the bowsprit, a smaller plume of smoke rising from his pipe.

#### Encounter: Trial Combat

Rayco wants to take revenge on a certain whale for killing his wife. He’s designed a harpoon he believes could cripple the Kraken, but he doesn’t feel comfortable putting his life in mortal danger without being sure that it does. He made a promise to his wife that he wouldn’t do anything stupid, so he’s going to test this plan’s stupidity before committing to it. He asks the party to act as a replacement for his whale-hunting crew -- or, more accurately, as bait.

The party must dive into the sea and distract Old Graybeard, an ancient, formidable whale that Rayco has been attempting to hunt for years, while Rayco uses his harpoons against it to test their efficacy. While the fight will end if the party successfully reduces Old Graybeard’s HP to zero, all they truly need to do is survive for three rounds. At the end of each round of combat, Rayco launches a harpoon from his ship, automatically hitting Old Graybeard. Once Old Graybeard has taken three harpoons, it falls to 0 HP, allowing Rayco to capture it.
### [[Golden Carvers]]
Despite the tension in the air around you, the Merry Mermaid always bustles with life and good cheer. Several pairs of shrewd eyes follow you, though, as you climb weather-worn stairs all the way up to the third floor and knock on the door with the golden handle.

A well-dressed half-elf, bedecked in jewelry, shows you in through an apartment twice as opulent as Coral Castle itself, and into... the bathroom? The room is richly appointed, with painted tilework, gold and porcelain fixtures, and, in pride of place by the open window, a claw-footed, solid gold bathtub.

A human reclines in the tub, arms splayed out to rest on its lip and head lolled to the side in complete relaxation. They regard you with hooded eyes, gold shimmering on their lids, and a crooked smile.

“I hear you have a business... proposition for me.”

#### Encounter: Trial by Combat

To convince Aurum to help, the party must first face them and their Golden Carvers in a fight; if the party is to lead the defense, they need to prove they are up to the task and that this is not a losing battle. Aurum does not take jobs that can go wrong. They pit their entire crew against the party, regardless of the party’s own numbers.

No matter who wins, Aurum will only agree to help if they are promised the spoils from the Kraken: its corpse, and any parts, pieces, and secretions it leaves behind. They plan to sell it to the northern wizards as spell components, flood the market to drive down the astronomical price until all their competitors are forced to retire, and then form a monopoly. With the right preservation methods, a Kraken’s corpse can last centuries; with the size of this one, the Golden Carvers could sell its parts for generations.

The Golden Carvers currently at the tavern are a crew of 5, plus Aurum themself. The crew is comprised of Argentum, Margarita, Carbuncle, Sapphyrus, and Cuprum, who are all Bandit Captains. If you prefer a higher challenge, consider raising the damage of Aurum’s weapon attack and change the stat blocks to be 2 Bandit Captains, 2 Veterans, and 1 Knight.  

- Enemies: Aurum, 5 Bandit Captains
- Aurum has no desire to kill the party, but does want to dispatch them quickly if they are no match for them. They will not hold back, but won’t kill any of them unless the party kills one of their crew.
- Aurum will use their blood magic to extend their survivability in combat, and they’ll make liberal use of their Cunning Action trait to weave in and out of the front lines.
- Aurum will forfeit if the party threatens to kill one of their crew or if their HP goes below 20 and they have no uses of Blood Transfusion left.
- A Golden Carver cleric will take care of Aurum’s wounds as they get back into the tub, along with the injuries of the rest of the Carvers.
- Aurum will gladly command their cleric to heal the party, too, for only 100 gold pieces per person. Anyone who agrees receives a level 2 cure wounds and a lesser restoration to cure Aurum’s poison.
### [[Dead Mens Song]]
To the north of Port Royal, past the harbour, past the docks and the last long piers, there is a long stretch of rocky beach. The waves lap gently at your feet, but the riptide is strong and cruel, tugging hard as if to pull you deeper. A few vaguely humanoid shapes in the distance turn their heads as if hearing or smelling you on the breeze, then dive quickly into the sea, swimming out only a short distance before diving deep.

Mere moments later, a head breaks the surface of the water near you, followed by a pair of powerful shoulders. A selkie regards you with large, impassive black eyes.

“My kindred warned me of your approach.”

#### ### Encounter: Trial by Combat

Long ago, the city of Blackwater Lagoon made a pact with the Merfolk kindred who resided in the Kin-Grounds, this stretch of beach and underwater cave systems: the city would recognize the kindred’s sovereign land and respect their independence, and in turn, the Merfolk would contribute to the city’s fishing efforts, corralling schools of fish into the city-folk’s nets and sharing the yield. They have maintained this symbiotic relationship for generations -- but the new government has not reinitiated diplomacy with the kindred to prove that they are still worthy hunt-mates. Since the party has been chosen by the princess, Atop a Rock asks them to represent her in a trial by combat. They’ll choose a number of fighters equal to the party’s numbers to make it a fair fight.

- Enemies: Atop a Rock, 2 Merfolk Bruisers, 1 Merfolk Wavesinger
- Atop a Rock will swear -- and make the player characters swear -- that the fight won’t turn deadly. He and his kindred will deal non-lethal damage, and he expects the party to do the same.
- Atop a Rock and the Merfolk Bruisers will use Pack Tactics and Atop a Rock’s Might of the Kindred trait to go on the offensive, while the Merfolk Wavesinger concentrates on support and healing from the backlines.
- Atop a Rock will forfeit when he’s the last one standing and his HP is low enough (below 20).
- If the party has maintained their agreement and has not used lethal force during combat, the kindred will heal their wounds during a Short Rest after combat, regardless of the outcome.
### [[The Guilded Pillagers]]
Past the lighthouse, on the gentle green slope that produces much of [[Realm of Evocation/The Pirate Republic/Towns/Port Royal|Port Royal]]'s food lies an unusual building. Unusual to port royal that is, built almost like a Haastian [[Exchange]] from the most refined of materials. It follows the usual design, opening into an open patio on the ground floor, with the balcony of the second flood over looking this and the ceiling of that floor covering the sky outside, illuminated with a great many oil lamps among the walls and ceiling, in the place the crier would usually sit, opposite the entrance behind a desk on the second floor balcony sits a thri-kreen looking over papers neatly sorted on her treated ironwood desk. 

#### Encounter: Promises
While Claxton is confident in his own strength he is currently seeking new allies. When the party arrives he will be in a meeting with both [[Krok Backwater]] and [[Marshall Teach]] regarding his previous allegiance to the fallen gods and the possibility of war as well as his recent efforts to reignite certain [[Realmgate]]s, one of which is within the secret library of the palace in [[Blackwater Lagoon]]. He is eager to help the party so long as he can be guranteed free access to the castle. He is somewhat rushed in this endeavour as he and his previous guests are to set out to halt a convoy headed for [[Realm of Evocation/The Pirate Republic/Towns/Port Royal|Port Royal]]. 
### [[The Krakens]]
Following some directions you received from a man at the docks you enter one of the taverns higher up on the cliff of port royal, the sweet smell of fruit, roasting birds and rum mix like a swirl of colours through the air. Its not hard to spot the blue form of [[Pelagie Wayward]] and her first mate [[Raul Sahiir]] sitting at a table at what could be described as the prow of this ship like building where windows cut into the walls and slits in the floor allow for a view of the eternal fog that guards port royal. Along with the two of them sit [[Zheng Yi Sao]] and [[Bedario Sabbag]]. They seem to be having a fairly agitated conversation that dies down as you approach.
### [[Saltmother Cathaysa]]

South past the harbor, past the shipyard, past the docks, past all the hustle and bustle of life, a sheer cliff rises above the sea. It’s a slippery climb down to where the rocks meet the sea, and the tide is already beginning to rise as you finally stand before the mouth of Reek Reef. It laps at your heels, urging you forward into the damp, fetid darkness of the caverns.


Even within the cave system, torches guttering from the water that drips from the walls and ceilings, the way is treacherous. The slow, inevitable force of the tides have carved divots and pools into the rock floor; slick algae and seaweed grow wherever they can find purchase; and tiny sea vermin scuttle underfoot and chitter in your ears.


Finally, you find the cavern opening up before you. The damp dimness is lit only by the glow of bioluminescent algae, casting everything in an eerie blue-green light. Against the backdrop of salt-crusted stone, the shape of a humanoid, hunched and gnarled and half overtaken by barnacles, greets you.


“Who comes to grovel before the Sunken Harridan?”

#### ### Encounter: Trial by Combat

Saltmother Cathaysa will only aid Cape Coral if it is the will of her goddess. Therefore, she requires the party to undergo the Trial of the Sunken Harridan. She leads the group deep into the caves of the Reek Reef, then prays to her goddess to test them. The trial in question is a minion rush: At the start of the trial, 5 Sahuagin appear and 2 Hunter Sharks attack the party. On initiative count 20 of the third round, 5 more Sahuagin and 2 Merrows appear. On initiative count 20 of the fourth and final round, a statue of the Sunken Harridan awakens as a Gargoyle and attacks the party. At least one of the players must survive four rounds, after which all enemies dissolve into a briny puddle and the statue will return to inanimate stone.

Cathaysa does not believe for an instant that the Sunken Harridan might want to stop the Kraken, so she submits the party to trial in an effort to incapacitate them. If she succeeds in downing all of the party members, she plans to drown them as sacrifices to her goddess. If the party prevails, though, and survives the Trial, Saltmother Cathaysa deduces that the Kraken was not, in fact, sent by the Sunken Harridan, and that the goddess was in fact testing the party to see whether they were worthy of fighting alongside her worshippers against it. Upon realizing this, Cathaysa pledges wholeheartedly to lend a hand in the upcoming attack.
