## **III. History and Lore**

- **Founding:** Aslava is recorded to have been founded as a country 1000 years before [[The Age of Discovery]] by the first Aslavan King [[Eiric Vols]], who at the time doubled as the first [[Höfuðdrápari]]. Legend says [[The Sacred Ironwood]] spoke to him of great empires past and to rebuild the glory that was once known throughout the world. This caused [[Eiric Vols]] to declare [[The Sacred Ironwood]] as the starting point of a his country. What followed was 500 years of conflict known as [[The Ísblóð Wars]] that had [[Eiric Vols]] and his successors subjugate the various tribes of Aslava while placing their generals to become the Jarls of large sections of land.

- **Relationship with Other Countries:** Aslava has been on a warpath with many other countries on and off since the reign of [[Aldor Haxhaker]] that kicked off [[The Age Of Rending]] due to the ideologies of witch hunting the country has held since then. The doctrines put in place has created tense airs whenever dealing with countries that have voiced their support and protection of those capable of wielding [[The Strings of Magic]].

## **IV. Military and Defence**

- **Military Structure:** As a heavily militarised state Aslava demands that as a coming of age ceremony every man must have military training for its navy, army or, in rare cases, the dreaded [[Haxjagere]].
- **Military Strength:** Aslava is widely regarded by other countries as the greatest military threat in the world, even without any magic within its ranks, the feverish determination of its troops are often enough to overcome the most dire of odds. Despite this Aslava has not made any attempts at invading other countries for over 300 years.
- **Important Military Victories or Defeats:** Aslava has had many attempts to Push through the [[Great Wall Mountains]] into Toscana but have been thwarted due to the aerial superiority of Toscana, the unfavourable terrain in the mountains and the great fortress of [[Maximus Reach]], the most famous of these being [[The Battle of Greatwall Pass]] that saw a collective 60,000 troops from all of the clans of [[Toscana]] defend against a force of 1 million Aslavans. It also attempted an overseas invasion of [[Araluuen]] called [[The Siege of King's Isle]] that was thwarted due to the efforts of [[The Royal Rangers]], [[House Titania]] and [[House Blakehaven]] that created a rift in reality that left the invasion force stranded on the [[Reidville Peninsula]] south of [[Araluuen]] and jumping them forward 600 years in time leaving them as an independent society, thereby strengthening the resentment of the Aslavan people towards mages. After [[Aldor Haxhaker]] declared [[The Age Of Rending]] he led a campaign of raids known as [[The Bowstring Raids]] in search of mages with the newly re-established [[Haxjagere]].
