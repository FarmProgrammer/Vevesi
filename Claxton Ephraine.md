**Name:** Claxtopn Ephraine, [[Hendrik Nassarau_Ende]]
- **Race:** Unknown (Human)
- **Age and Appearance:** Claxton Ephraine always wears a mask, under it he has the appearance of a youthful human in his mid 20s with brown hair and eyes, well kept side swept hair with a clean shaven face.
- **Personality:** Claxton is a doubting scheming man. Duplicitous he puts on a fa√ßade with almost everyone he meets making some think he is multiple people in one, there is some truth to this.
- **Motivation:** Claxton, or rather, Hendrik Nassarau/Ende ultimately wants to see a monarchy return to [[Haast]] with him as the rightful heir of the [[Nassarau]] name and therefore the rightful king.
- **Skills and Abilities:** Claxton is above all a master manipulator and tactician and prefers to let others fight if it comes to it, but should it be needed he is no slouch on the battlefield, seeming to be so fast he disappears from sight striking devastating blows, his fleet footedness and vibrant outfit yet stealth have earned him the moniker by some as the war jester. But perhaps the gift that has allowed him to deepen these talents is that of immortality, as he has been alive since [[The Crownfall Rebellion]], making him, just over 700 years old.
- **Strengths and Weaknesses:** Despite his calculating nature and intelligence Claxton can come to be shot sighted if presented a opportunity to further his main goal, as he sees his right to rule as divine he does not believe any plan that directly furthers it can go wrong, leading to fits of rage if it does.
- **Backstory:** What is the character's history? What events have shaped them into who they are today?
- **Relationships:** Claxton keeps a close eye on all his admirals, among them some stand out such as:
	- [[The Baron]]

You speak of great treasures to be found and such fortune certainly to follow or precede. You speak of constant perils and excitement upon the azure expanse known as the ocean, allow me to illustrate a point with the following tale, of one Lady O.

It was thus with great trepidation that Lady O. entered the room. She found a company already assembled in a semicircle round the fire. Lady R., an oldish lady, of dark complexion, with a black lace mantilla on her head, was seated in a great arm-chair in the centre. Thus being somewhat deaf, she could control the conversation on both sides of her. You see, she was said to hold the societal encounters that presented with them the most wit. On both sides of her sat men and women of the highest distinction. Every man, it was said, had been a minister and every woman, it was whispered, had been the mistress of a king or lord. Certain it is that all were brilliant, and all were famous. Lady O. took her seat with a deep reverence in silence...After three hours, she curtseyed profoundly and left.

But what, the you may ask with some exasperation, happened in between. In three hours, such a company must have said the wittiest, the profoundest, the most interesting things in the world. So it would seem indeed. But the fact appears to be that they said nothing. It is a curious characteristic which they share with all the most brilliant societies that the world has seen. Old [[Madame Isia le Ruse Austenford]] and her friends talked for fifty years without stopping. And of it all, what remains? Perhaps three witty sayings. So that we are at liberty to suppose either that nothing was said, or that nothing witty was said, or that the fraction of three witty sayings lasted eighteen thousand two hundred and fifty nights, which does not leave a liberal allowance of wit for any one of them.

The truth would seem to be--if we dare use such a word in such a connection--that all these groups of people lie under an enchantment. The hostess is our modern [[Hyacintha]]. She is a witch who lays her guests under a spell. In this house they think themselves happy; in that witty; in a third profound. It is all an illusion (which is nothing against it, for illusions are the most valuable and necessary of all things, and she who can create one is among the world's greatest benefactors), but as it is notorious that illusions are shattered by conflict with reality, so no real happiness, no real wit, no real profundity are tolerated where the illusion prevails. This serves to explain why [[Madame Isia le Ruse Austenford]] said no more than three witty things in the course of fifty years. Had she said more, her circle would have been destroyed. The witticism, as it left her lips, bowled over the current conversation as a cannon ball lays low the violets and the daisies. When she made her famous 'mot de Saint Denis' the very grass was singed. Disillusionment and desolation followed. Not a word was uttered. 'Spare us another such, for Heaven's sake, Madame!' her friends cried with one accord. And she obeyed. For almost seventeen years she said nothing memorable and all went well. The beautiful counterpane of illusion lay unbroken on her circle as it lay unbroken on the circle of Lady R. The guests thought that they were happy, thought that they were witty, thought that they were profound, and, as they thought this, other people thought it still more strongly; and so it got about that nothing was more delightful than one of Lady R.'s assemblies; everyone envied those who were admitted; those who were admitted envied themselves because other people envied them; and so there seemed no end to it.

In this lies your conundrum you see, you speak of bounties, merriment, fortune. To do so shall be an illusion held by the brief moments of trepidation and glee. For the hyperbole of extremes is unattainable and the importance lies in casting a net of illusions upon the company you wish to impress.
