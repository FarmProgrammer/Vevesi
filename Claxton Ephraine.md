**Name:** Claxtopn Ephraine, [[Hendrik Nassarau_Ende]]
- **Race:** Unknown (Human)
- **Age and Appearance:** Claxton Ephraine always wears a mask, under it he has the appearance of a youthful human in his mid 20s with brown hair and eyes, well kept side swept hair with a clean shaven face.
- **Personality:** Claxton is a doubting scheming man. Duplicitous he puts on a fa√ßade with almost everyone he meets making some think he is multiple people in one, there is some truth to this.
- **Motivation:** Claxton, or rather, Hendrik Nassarau/Ende ultimately wants to see a monarchy return to [[Haast]] with him as the rightful heir of the [[Nassarau]] name and therefore the rightful king.
- **Skills and Abilities:** Claxton is above all a master manipulator and tactician and prefers to let others fight if it comes to it, but should it be needed he is no slouch on the battlefield, seeming to be so fast he disappears from sight striking devastating blows, his fleet footedness and vibrant outfit yet stealth have earned him the moniker by some as the war jester. But perhaps the gift that has allowed him to deepen these talents is that of immortality, as he has been alive since [[The Crownfall Rebellion]], making him, just over 700 years old.
- **Strengths and Weaknesses:** Despite his calculating nature and intelligence Claxton can come to be shot sighted if presented a opportunity to further his main goal, as he sees his right to rule as divine he does not believe any plan that directly furthers it can go wrong, leading to fits of rage if it does.
- **Backstory:** What is the character's history? What events have shaped them into who they are today?
- **Relationships:** Claxton keeps a close eye on all his admirals, among them some stand out such as:
	- [[The Baron]]
