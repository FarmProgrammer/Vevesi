The civil war following the emperor's death has been raging for years. Factions such as the new empire of [[Xu Jiang]] and the hegemony of [[Mata Zyndu]] and [[Cocru]] are flattening land and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths as their armies clash with the forces of the empire lead by [[Tanno Namen]]. [[Kuni Garu]] has been leading your group for years, after being kicked out of [[Zudi]] and becoming bandits you have been reaccepted, become royalty, getting pushed into the larger conflict and holding the gates at the pivotal [[Battle of Zudi]] with [[Mata Zindu]]. Now come time for another decisive battle, this time with even less reinforcements. [[Luan Ziaji]] has shown [[Kuni Garu]] a way, after a ride across the waves and commandeering an airship you are approaching the imperial palace for an action that could end this war.

## Act 1: 
### Flight in and plan
Kuni Garu hopes the party can distract the palace guards and intentionally fight towards the wrong location distracting most of the guard while he and a select few move towards the main throne room.
### Customs inspection mid flight
Wyvern riders will attempt to board the ship to check it before reaching the airspace above [[Kororobe]]. They will pressure the driver and such, if the players kill the riders they will have to either try and use the wyverns to reach the city and clear the airship for landing or take a loud approach as no one will clear the airship for landing.
## Act 2: 
### Infiltration or Loud from the start
This phase will vary depending on whether the party uses **stealth** or goes in **loud**. Either way, enemies should challenge the players' ability to adapt while conserving resources for the final showdown.

#### **Infiltration Path: Traps, Constructs, and Magical Defenses**

1. **Arcane Sentinels (Level 7)**:
    
    - Automaton guards that patrol the palace and detect intruders.
    - Abilities: Gaze attacks or area denial with magical bursts (similar to _Fireball_).
2. **Imperial Seers (Level 8)**:
    
    - **Occult Spellcasters** with divination magic that can alert guards to the players’ movements.
    - Abilities: _Scrying_, _See Invisibility_, _Phantasmal Killer_.
    - **Tactics**: They stay hidden while summoning creatures like **Shadow Demons (Level 8)** to delay the party.

#### **Loud Path: Elite Guards and a Mid-Boss**

1. **Imperial Guards (Level 6–8)**:
    
    - **Soldiers** (Level 6) as mooks to provide a sense of overwhelming numbers.
    - Add **Captains (Level 8)** as squad leaders with feats like _Attack of Opportunity_ or _Shield Block_.
2. **Elite Mid-Boss: Beast or Veteran Commander**:
    
    - **Chimera (Level 9)**: A terrifying creature unleashed from the palace’s stables. Its mix of melee and breath weapons creates a varied threat.
    - **Martial Commander (Level 9)**: A highly mobile melee-focused boss with strong defenses. Abilities like _Disruptive Stance_ or _Stand Still_ can counter spellcasters and evasive players.
## Act 3:
### Head of the Imperial Guard fight
As the fight progresses the players awaken the protector of the imperial palace, an adult omen dragon. After 5 rounds kuni garu will reach and capture the emperor at which point the player can try and get the dragon to stand down.
