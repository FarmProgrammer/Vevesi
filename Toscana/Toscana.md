# History

### - How far back does common recorded history go?
Within Toscana recorded history goes back roughly 2700 years to when the  clans first expanded, originally over 600 different clans the 11 known today were those that rose above the rest in slaughter or peaceful unification, creating so the union of the 11 clans that persists today.
### - How much is known of time before recorded history?
Little is known before the 2700 years ago as the clans were too small and most knowledge came from stories or word of mouth from generation to generation.
### - To what degree does the history of different cultures/races vary?
While the history as recorded by the Aaracokra is the most prevalent and taught each race owes its ancestry primarily to a different clan.
### - Are there relics of earlier eras that predate this?
Yes, every now and then a ruin or mausoleum is discovered that is estimated to be over 10000 years old.
### - What form do these relics take? (ruined cities, massive standing stones, ancient but common near-indestructible charms passed down through families, etc).
Any of the above.
### - What is known?
At the turning of [[The Age Of Rending]] Toscana was invaded by their neighbour, [[Aslava]]. It took the clans 200 years to reclaim all land south of [[Quintus Fields]]. In this war the head of [[Clan Maximus]] was killed but the younger son of [[Clan Jupiter]] took to the field with such ferocity and strategy that the remainder of [[Clan Maximus]] proclaimed him their new leader. this period of time was known as [[The End of Rending]] and much of the current unstable state of Toscana is owed to this even over 400 years later.
### - What is not known?
[[The Old War]]

### - What is suspected?
Many Toscanan Scholars from [[Clan Marcellus]] or [[Clan Jupiter]] believe that Toscana once held dominion over the known world, as evidenced by the wide array of objects in the ancient tombs found.

# Technology

### What is personal weapon technology like? For the military? For civilians? (melee? ranged?)
For the military:

	 Ranged:
		 Standard issue dictates a gladius, single shot black powder rifle, breastplate and helmet.

Toscana is fairly new to the invention of black powder weapons but does already have them in use in the military.

# Economy
### - What goods are produced and where are they produced?
As with most other things Toscana is greatly varied by region when it comes to the goods that it produces, whereas [[Clan Quintus]] produces most of the edible goods within the country, [[Clan Aelius]] produces most of the armaments and defensive goods. [[Clan Marcellus]] has a relatively active market of artistic commissions such as busts or paintings. [[Clan Tulius]] will often work outside of the country as mediators in political agreements or assist the trading agreements made by the [[Trading Companies Of Haast]]. [[Clan Caelia]] is not known for any major exports, imports or economic activities at all but often infiltrate other clans in their ventures to reach whatever covert operation they require. [[Clan Maximus]] produces many mercenary companies in its military schools but most natives to the can would rather live the life of a soldier at [[Hadrian's Reach]] rather than become sellswords. [[Clan Jupiter]] is known for dabbling in many areas and any trade undertaken by one of the clans is often undertaken to a lesser extent by [[Clan Jupiter]]. [[Clan Horatia]] often sells horses or other rideable livestock such as [[Stompers]] and occasionally [[Griphons]], [[Wyverns]], [[Pegasuses]] and [[Hippogriffs]]. [[Clan Valerius]] is known for its craftmanship and architecture and as such are occasionally contracted to assist in the design of overseas buildings. [[Clan Flaviana]] does not produce many of its own good instead being the main trading clan for Toscana assisting the [[Trading Companies Of Haast]] with shipping and other such endeavours.
### - What are the major trade goods?
While most of the goods produced by Toscana are traded nationally it mostly imports luxury goods and is known for smugglers in its western ports. These legally or otherwise imported goods range from furniture and [[magic items]] to drugs such as [[Jurda]]  and [[Ferna]] and slaves from [[Nassarau]]. Its exports vary greatly by region but consists mostly of armour from [[Clan Aelius]] and cork and olive oil from [[Clan Quintus]].
### - Are there trading centres?
Most trading centres are along the cost at ports, and during the winter month [[Hadrian's Reach]] becomes a trading centre for [[Aslava]].
### - Are there banks?
While there may not be formal banks in the traditional sense, certain clans, especially those involved in trade, may act as financial intermediaries and moneylenders.
### - Do people barter or use money?
Both bartering and the use of money are common. Bartering might be more prevalent in rural areas, while urban centers and trade hubs rely heavily on currency.
### - If money is used, is it valuable itself or is it fiat currency?
Money in Toscana is valuable in itself, representing a tangible and recognized store of value. It is typically backed by the economic output of the various clans.
### - Are there generally acceptable standards for coins?
Coins likely adhere to standardized weights and designs set by a central authority or a consensus among the major clans to facilitate trade.
