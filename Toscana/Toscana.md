# Economy
### - What goods are produced and where are they produced?
As with most other things Toscana is greatly varied by region when it comes to the goods that it produces, whereas [[Clan Quintus]] produces most of the edible goods within the country, [[Clan Aelius]] produces most of the armaments and defensive goods. [[Clan Marcellus]] has a relatively active market of artistic commissions such as busts or paintings. [[Clan Tulius]] will often work outside of the country as mediators in political agreements or assist the trading agreements made by the [[Trading Companies Of Haast]]. [[Clan Caelia]] is not known for any major exports, imports or economic activities at all but often infiltrate other clans in their ventures to reach whatever covert operation they require. [[Clan Maximus]] produces many mercenary companies in its military schools but most natives to the can would rather live the life of a soldier at [[Hadrian's Reach]] rather than become sellswords. [[Clan Jupiter]] is known for dabbling in many areas and any trade undertaken by one of the clans is often undertaken to a lesser extent by [[Clan Jupiter]]. [[Clan Horatia]] often sells horses or other rideable livestock such as [[Stompers]] and occasionally [[Griphons]], [[Wyverns]], [[Pegasuses]] and [[Hippogriffs]]. [[Clan Valerius]] is known for its craftmanship and architecture and as such are occasionally contracted to assist in the design of overseas buildings. [[Clan Flaviana]] does not produce many of its own good instead being the main trading clan for Toscana assisting the [[Trading Companies Of Haast]] with shipping and other such endeavours.
### - What are the major trade goods?
While most of the goods produced by Toscana are traded nationally it mostly imports luxury goods and is known for smugglers in its western ports. These legally or otherwise imported goods range from furniture and [[magic items]] to drugs such as [[Jurda]]  and [[Ferna]] and slaves from [[Nassarau]]. Its exports vary greatly by region but consists mostly of armour from [[Clan Aelius]] and cork and olive oil from [[Clan Quintus]].
### - Are there trading centres?
Most trading centres are along the cost at ports, and during the winter month [[Hadrian's Reach]] becomes a trading centre for [[Aslava]].
### - Are there banks?
While there may not be formal banks in the traditional sense, certain clans, especially those involved in trade, may act as financial intermediaries and moneylenders.
### - Do people barter or use money?
Both bartering and the use of money are common. Bartering might be more prevalent in rural areas, while urban centers and trade hubs rely heavily on currency.
### - If money is used, is it valuable itself or is it fiat currency?
Money in Toscana is valuable in itself, representing a tangible and recognized store of value. It is typically backed by the economic output of the various clans.
### - Are there generally acceptable standards for coins?
Coins likely adhere to standardized weights and designs set by a central authority or a consensus among the major clans to facilitate trade.
### - How easy and common is counterfeiting?
Counterfeiting may exist but is likely uncommon due to the centralized control or consensus regarding coinage standards. Clans involved in trade and economic activities such as [[Clan Tulius]] may have stringent measures in place to prevent counterfeiting.
