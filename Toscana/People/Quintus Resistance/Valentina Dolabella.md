>We do not know what our chances of survival are, so we fight as if they were zero. We do not know what we are facing, so we fight as if it was Alexander and Jupiter themselves. No one will remember us now and we may never be buried beneath The plains we call home, so we will build our own memorial here. The Clan might lose us and Toscana might never know we existed, but the Enemy — the Enemy will know. The Enemy will remember. We will hurt it so badly that it will never forget us until the stars burn out and all lands fall at the end of time. When Jupiter is dying, its last thought will be of us. That is our memorial — carved into the heart of Jupiter. We cannot lose, Quintus. We have already won.
