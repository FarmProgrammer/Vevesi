> 'This is what they send? This _rabble_? We hold one of the mightiest armies Toscana has ever seen. The fury of our firearms sends all skyborne enemies to the ground in flames. We stand united in our thousands - our weapons without number, our purity without question, and our hearts beating courage through our blood. And this is how they attack us?'

> '_Never again in life will your actions carry such consequences. Never again will you serve as you serve now. No duty will matter as much, and no glory will taste as grand. We are the defenders of Toscana. On this day, we carve our legend in the flesh of every traitor we slay. Will you stand with me?_'

Legate Alexander Helios is a child of a Jupiter branch family and has made a name as one of the best tactical minds of the current time. Currently the most accomplished legate within the war having been responsible for the taking of Flaviana and capable of seizing the most powerful navy in Toscana. Little is known of his upbringing except that the old Queen had a hand in how it was done.

Alexander is a brash yet inspiring man with a keen mind and sharp tongue, though his sword arm is not as strong as many fear that does not mean he is to be underestimated.
