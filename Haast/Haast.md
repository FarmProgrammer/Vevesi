Haast, a small island to the west of [[Toscana]] and east of [[Araluuen]]. Despite its small size its abundance of natural ports turned Haast into one of the first countries to take to the seas. This advance lead to has having a global monopoly on overseas trade. This massive lead led to Haast deposing its monarchy to be replaced by a putative oligarchy in which a council of 10 of the richest traders of Haast rule the country and its remaining colony, [[Nassarau]]. Haast is mostly comprised of humans, though the slums in any of its 11 main cities are a melting pot of many a person who came to Haast to find their fortune.

## **III. History and Lore**

- **Founding:** Haast started as a small feudal state and has history that goes back roughly 700 years before [[The Age of Discovery]]. It is suspected by historians in [[Araluuen]] and [[Toscana]] that the first settlers of Haast may have come from either of those landmasses with the founder of [[The Nassarau Family]] as there is archaeological elements to support a land bridge at some point between [[Araluuen]] going through [[Mansbridge Isle]] or a peninsula of mainland [[Toscana]] that would have also included [[Sabaria]].
- **Major Events:** [[The Crownfall Rebellion]] at the turn of [[The Age of Seas]] saw [[The Nassarau Family]] deposed and replaced with the [[Merchant Council]]. [[The Oceanic Drought]] pushed out the territory of haast's colony, [[Nassarau]], this also caused a rebellion that led to the reinstatement of [[At Tadhimiya]].
- **Myths and Legends:** Due to the history of haast many of its legends and myths are nautical in nature with ones such as [[The Giant of the Wasted Cape]] or [[The Legend of the grand Kraken]] as well as some that were verified like [[The Eye of Astrid]].
- **Relationship with Other Countries:** As the forefront of international trade Haast has a vice grip on almost every country as going against Haast would all but eradicate international trade for that country.

## **IV. Military and Defence**

- **Military Structure:** While Haast does have an official army it exists mostly only to police its cities and its colony, its navy however, funded mostly by the [[Merchant Council]] is the military pride of the nation, many joke that the permanence of pirates is only due to the [[Merchant Council]] not seeing any need to eradicate them since their own vessels usually travel with an escort, 100 years after [[The Crownfall Rebellion]] the [[Merchant Council]] decreed that each member of the council must maintain an active standing force each consisting of a fleet of at least 100 vessels meaning the country, if it were to bring its full might to bear could call upon at least 2000 military vessels with trained and manned crews..
- **Military Strength:** While a land invasion from Haast forces is borderline impossible for the country to accomplish should the entire [[Merchant Council]] agree on a perceived threat they would have the power to cripple any country financially through debt collection, trade restrictions and of course naval bombardment.
- **Important Military Victories or Defeats:** [[The Refounding of At Tadhymia]] presents the so far greatest stain on the history of Haast and showed its on land weakness to the world at large.

Despite the illegality of slavery in Haast [[Indentured Servitude]] is all too common, often those servants coming from seemingly thin air.
- **Trade:** As mentioned before [[Haast]] controls all overseas trade and acts as a middleman for any trade between 2 countries, other than its official position haast also has many gangs that have beenm come to be colectively known as the [[Dreg Merchants]], often larger companies will work with these gangs to trade under the table. Many ex royals and forsaken traders in Haast will use what remains of their influence to undergo training and become one of the many [[Haastian Mercenaries]] in a process known as [[Herwinnen]].
