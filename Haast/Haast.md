Haast, a small island to the west of [[Toscana]] and east of [[Araluuen]]. Despite its small size its abundance of natural ports turned Haast into one of the first countries to take to the seas. This advance lead to has having a global monopoly on overseas trade. This massive lead led to Haast deposing its monarchy to be replaced by a putative oligarchy in which a council of 10 of the richest traders of Haast rule the country and its remaining colony, [[Nassarau]]. Haast is mostly comprised of humans, though the slums in any of its 4 main cities are a melting pot of many a person who came to Haast to find their fortune.
