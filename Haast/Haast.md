Haast, a small island to the west of [[Toscana]] and east of [[Araluuen]]. Despite its small size its abundance of natural ports turned Haast into one of the first countries to take to the seas. This advance lead to has having a global monopoly on overseas trade. This massive lead led to Haast deposing its monarchy to be replaced by a putative oligarchy in which a council of 10 of the richest traders of Haast rule the country and its remaining colony, [[Nassarau]]. Haast is mostly comprised of humans, though the slums in any of its 11 main cities are a melting pot of many a person who came to Haast to find their fortune.

- **Climate:** Due to the size of the country it is under only one climate, a temperate maritime one.

## **II. People and Culture**

- **Government:** Though originally under a monarchy from the [[Nassarau Royal Family]] these have since been deposed and replaced with a putative oligarchy.
- **Social Structure:** There is no official class structure within the country, however, due to its worship of money and trade Haast is often the homeplace of stark divides between the rich and poor.

- **Religion(s):** Haast worships [[Geldrax]], the god of greed and gold and holds 3 of the largest cathedrals to him in the cities of [[Zoutport]], [[Vosham]] and [[Hellouw]].
- **Culture:** Haast, as a country that worships money places greater value on material wealth than anything else has developed a individualistic ideology for its people. People from Haast are known to have little time and much to do. Restaurants that don't specifically serve the ultra wealthy are known to have timers for each table to speed up their patrons. The casinos of Haast never close and no city in the country ever truly sleeps.
- **Holidays and Festivals:** 
	- [[The Grand Auction]], a weeklong auction held in [[Zoutport]] at [[The Church of Barter]] headed by the [[High Priest of Geldrax]] that sees products be auctioned for enough money to fund cities for years.
	- [[Investor's Day]], a late autumn day meant to celebrate entrepreneurship and returns for propositions, on this day it is custom for banks to offer temporarily discounted loans and for successful businesses to pay a large sum of profits to their shareholder, though often this is expected to come out of the common workers' pay to show their appreciation.

## **III. History and Lore**

- **Founding:** Haast started as a small feudal state and has history that goes back roughly 700 years before [[The Age of Discovery]]. It is suspected by historians in [[Araluuen]] and [[Toscana]] that the first settlers of Haast may have come from either of those landmasses with the founder of [[The Nassarau Family]] as there is archaeological elements to support a land bridge at some point between [[Araluuen]] going through [[Mansbridge Isle]] or a peninsula of mainland [[Toscana]] that would have also included [[Sabaria]].
- **Major Events:** [[The Crownfall Rebellion]] at the turn of [[The Age of Seas]] saw [[The Nassarau Family]] deposed and replaced with the [[Merchant Council]]. [[The Oceanic Drought]] pushed out the territory of haast's colony, [[Nassarau]], this also caused a rebellion that led to the reinstatement of [[At Tadhimiya]].
- **Myths and Legends:** Due to the history of haast many of its legends and myths are nautical in nature with ones such as [[The Giant of the Wasted Cape]] or [[The Legend of the grand Kraken]] as well as some that were verified like [[The Eye of Astrid]].
- **Relationship with Other Countries:** As the forefront of international trade Haast has a vice grip on almost every country as going against Haast would all but eradicate international trade for that country.

## **IV. Military and Defence**

- **Military Structure:** While haast does have an official army it exists mostly only to police its cities and its colony, its navy however, funded mostly by the [[Merchant Council]] is the military pride of the nation, many joke that the permanence of pirates is only due to the [[Merchant Council]] not seeing any need to eradicate them since their own vessels usually travel with an escort.
- **Military Strength:** While a land invasion from Haast forces is borderline impossible for the country to accomplish should the entire [[Merchant Council]] agree on a perceived threat they would have the power to cripple any country financially through debt collection, trade restrictions and of course naval bombardment.
- **Important Military Victories or Defeats:** [[The Refounding of At Tadhymia]] presents the so far greatest stain on the history of Haast and showed its on land weakness to the world at large.
