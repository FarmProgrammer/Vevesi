Haast, a small island to the east of Toscana and west of Araluuen. Despite its small size its abundance of natural ports turnes Haast into one of the first countries to take to the seas. This advance lead to haas having a global monopoly on overseas trade. This massive lead led to haast deposing its monarchy to be replaced by a putative oligarchy in which a council of 10 of the richest traders of haast rule the country and its remaining colony, Nassarau. Haast is mostly comprised of humans, though the slums in any of its 4 main cities are a melting pot of many a person who came to haast to find their fortune.
