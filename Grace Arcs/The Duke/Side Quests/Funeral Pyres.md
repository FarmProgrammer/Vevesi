**Quest Type**: Last rites/ Investigation
**Quest Giver**: [[Joost Slag]]
**Plot**: After the battle that decimated the Corps the teams in charge of burning the bodies have gone missing.
**Objective**: The party must make their way to the battlefield to discover why there have been no news from the disposal teams. As the players arrive the field smells of rotting flesh. The reason the groups went missing is that half deserted so the work slowed down, which attracted ghouls that killed what was left. The players must fight off the ghouls while burning the body piles
**Reward**: 3 +1 weapons from [[De Blanke Slag]] armoury.
