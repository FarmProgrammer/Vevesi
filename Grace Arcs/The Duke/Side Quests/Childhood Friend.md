**Quest Type**: Investigation
**Quest Giver**: [[Alberta Crispus]]
**Plot**: A young girl in Dertona posted a note to the quest board that her older brother has come is hurting her and she needs help, but the entire town knows that he disappeared years ago and will urge the players to waive it off as a child's imagination.
**Objective**: If the players still choose to investigate it there are a few people in town who they can ask, they have 2 days (unbeknownst to them) before the Bogey kills Alberta.
