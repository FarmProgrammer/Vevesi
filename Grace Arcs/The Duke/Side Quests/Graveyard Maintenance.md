**Quest Type**: Cleaning
**Quest Giver**: [[Lucina Rullus]]
**Plot**: Ghouls seem to have been trying to get into the graveyards in the valley of rivers again, Lucina would like the players to search around the valley for the graveyards and maintain the grave and kill any ghouls trying to get into them.
**Objective**: The party must travel to the 3 graveyards in the valley in the outskirts of the towns and tend to the graves and kill the few ghouls attracted by the area of death.
There will only be ghouls in the graveyard that is furthest south as any ghouls near the other two have been attracted to the battlefield as seen in [[Funeral Pyres]].
**Reward**: +1 local trust. Can restock for free (within reason) from the towns food stores.
