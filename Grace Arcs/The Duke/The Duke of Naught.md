In the peaceful mountains of quintus lies a secret, for years no authority has claimed it as quintus does not care to, but now with the encroaching imperius armies the truth is to be found.

For years upon years, over 250 this land has been ruled, not by its clan but by a being of nature, one whos eyes are trees and whos weapons are rot and decay. Every true night the hamlets and towns must offer tribute, or suffer the Duke's wrath. 

The players were sent into the mountains to scout and gain the trust of the locals and to evaluate main landmarks and locations to be fortified.
