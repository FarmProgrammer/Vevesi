## Geography:
At the Foothills of the Serra Clara range, one of the last ranges before approaching southern Quintus.

## Population:
~600

## Government: 
Dertona is governed by [[Lucina Rullus]], a strix and the head of the local winery, she handles the exports of Icewine and takes care of importing anything the governments in other local villages might need.

## Defence: 
Other than able bodied men and women Dertona, as is the case with every other village in this area, has no real defences.

## Commerce: 
### Docks:
Dertona has docks that work as a point of commerce, receiving logs from [[Ligna]] upstream. The Dulcis river passes through [[Apiaria]] where it joins the [[Mirabilis]] river that passes through [[Imperium]]. The local dockmaster is a Kobold named [[Maria Vasconcelos]].
### Dertona Water Mill:
The water mill, near the docks is where the locals can pay to have their grain processed into flower and made into bread. It is run by a centaur baker by the name of [[Estevão Rodrigues]].
### Icewine Winery:
Run by [[Lucina Rullus]] the winery is one of the largest building in Dertona. It has 3 main areas. Where the wine is produced, a fancy inn for travellers on a "wine tour" and an area that includes Lucina's office where she handles the governmental aspects of the region and has a small school to teach local children to read and write.

### Estalagem do Servo:
The Estalagem do servo is also funded by [[Lucina Rullus]] but is instead run by a kitsune called [[Felix Magnus]], a 3rd generation immigrant from [[Araluuen]]. It is a less expensive inn for travellers who are no the usual rich folk that pass through the winery.
### Octavian Robes:
While a lot of fixing clothes here is done by locals some stitches need an expert hand. As well as that tourists always love to buy some "local attire". To this end [[Quirinus Octavia]] runs Octavian Robes.
### Butcher:
To butcher the local animals [[Livia Crispus]] runs a butcher in the town square, she learned anatomy from her sister, Cassia but resents her because while Livia only ever became a butcher Cassia got to go off into the world and study to be a doctor.
### Healer's Hut:
[[Cassia Crispus]] runs a small healers shop out of her modest home, she is a capable alchemical healer and surgeon. Cassia is in part shunned by the town as they have an easier time remembering her failures than her successes. She does not make people pay for her treatment being instead funded by [[Lucina Rullus]].
### Tannery:
[[Flavia Octavia]] runs a local tannery in the same building as the butcher's and provides sturdy leather and hides to the town and her brother Quirinus.
### Adventurer's Hall:
The [[Adventurers Guild]] does in fact have an adventurers guild building, though long neglected it is now only staffed by a single Aslavan dwarf by the name of [[Merten Kunze]] who mostly just helps in odd jobs around town now.
