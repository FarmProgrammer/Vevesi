## Birth
Originally known as Nerva Messalla, The duke was a woodcutter that succumbed to starvation almost 400 years ago in the mountains of quintus. A woodcutter by trade her soul, denied an afterlife by the remnants of a machine from the ancient war. One made to prevent Felicity from consuming the souls of fae creatures fighting for the empire. The machine, however was missing a crucial component, the receptacle to hold the soul and the warforged bodies required for the soul to find a new one. Drifting for years on end Nerva's soul would bear witness and meld with the wilds of the valleys and wooded mountaintops. Seeing the savagery of the beasts in the valleys that became the cradle of lycanthropy Nerva's mind was degraded  and contorted over time, every death it bore witness to building the twisted, gaunt form that she now holds, the bones of prey contorted into heads and arms. 
And so being was born, with the cunning of the intelligent species and the savagery of the beasts The Duke claimed his seat in the wilds of Quintus.
## Current
Now the duke holds the remote towns in this region as his domain, and the people as his subjects. On every true night, (once a month), each town must make 2 offerings. 2 people, one young and fit, the other can be any person. Taken by the mist that comes on the true night these people are taken the the court of the duke, one to receive the blood of the highest subjects, the blood of a lycanthrope, and the other to be the feast for the duke and his court.
## Personality
The Duke is a cunning creature, with a ferocious hunger. Devoid of its humanity the duke seeks primarily to keep his dominion over the forests in these hills and the people therein, holding a sizeable force of over 50 lycanthropes in his court.
## Abilities
The Duke has the ability to see through tress, capable of stalking even the most experienced of hunters, and using those same tree to walk in through one and out through another.
