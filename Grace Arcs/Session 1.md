## Start
### **1. Initial Positioning and Skirmishes**

- **Corps des Flammes’ 1st Infantry Division** establishes a defensive line on a low ridge, with **Light Infantry Brigade** up front and **Heavy Infantry Brigade** in reserve, bracing for the heavy impact of Legio Aeries' disciplined advance.
- **De Blanke Slag (Mercenary Free Company)**: Positions themselves on the Corps’ far right, maintaining a cautious stance. Their leader, Captain Hendrik van Damme, expertly maneuvers them to hold ground without direct engagement, anticipating the heavier casualties Corps des Flammes might suffer.
- **Legio Aeries’ Prima Cohort** leads the advance in a rigid formation, supported by the **1st and 2nd Cohorts** behind, aiming to punch through the center of Corps des Flammes’ defenses.
- **Horation Cavalry Detachment** splits into two wings: the left wing advances along the flanks, while the right wing holds back, ready to exploit any gaps in Corps des Flammes’ lines.

### **2. Artillery Bombardment and Infantry Clashes**

- **Corps des Flammes’ Artillery Brigade** launches a devastating barrage, targeting the advancing **Prima Cohort** and disrupting their forward momentum. Still, Legio Aeries maintains discipline, slowly closing the distance.
- **Gun Brigade** supports the artillery by firing volleys into the **Legio Aeries' front line**, causing casualties but not breaking their disciplined ranks. The **1st Cohort of Legio Aeries** counters by forming shield walls, minimizing losses and continuing their advance.
- **Prima Cohort** and **1st Cohort** clash with Corps des Flammes’ **Heavy Infantry Brigade**, engaging in brutal, close-quarters combat. Corps des Flammes’ line begins to waver under the unrelenting discipline of Legio Aeries, leading to a bloody stalemate.

### **3. Flanking Threats and Cavalry Maneuvers**

- **Horation Cavalry (Left Wing)** executes a sweeping charge toward the exposed **Gun Brigade**, forcing them to pull back. **2nd Pike Regiment** from Corps des Flammes moves to intercept, but takes heavy casualties in the process.
- **Royal Strix Guard** attempts to protect the left flank by forming a shield wall and countering with support from **mounted handgun companies**. Their presence momentarily halts the Horation Cavalry, but the heavy engagement costs the Strix Guard dearly.
- **Right Wing Horation Cavalry** attempts a flanking maneuver but is intercepted by **De Blanke Slag’s pike formations**. Under Captain van Damme’s orders, De Blanke Slag holds firm, fending off the Horation Cavalry with minimal losses.

### **4. Central Breakthrough and Desperate Resistance**

- **Prima Cohort and 2nd Cohort (Legio Aeries)** break through the weakened **Heavy Infantry Brigade** line, causing Corps des Flammes to fall back. In response, **Pike Infantry Brigade** and **Magic Infantry Brigade** move in to plug the gap, but suffer heavily as Legio Aeries’ elite units continue their relentless assault.
- **De Blanke Slag’s Crossbowmen** provide crucial cover fire on the right flank, preventing Legio Aeries’ **3rd and 4th Cohorts** from advancing further. This strategic positioning and disciplined use of crossbows keeps De Blanke Slag's casualties low.

### **5. Horation Cavalry Charges and Tactical Repercussions**

- **Horation Cavalry (Central Detachment)** charges the Corps’ weakened center, momentarily breaking through. **Magic Infantry Brigade** casts powerful area spells to halt their advance, inflicting casualties on the Horations but drawing heavy fire from Legio Aeries archers, who take the opportunity to target the unarmored magic users.
- **Royal Strix Guard** suffers devastating losses while holding the left flank against relentless Horation Cavalry charges. Despite heroic resistance, only a fraction of the Strix Guard remains by this point in the battle.

### **6. Encirclement and Pyrrhic Victory**

- **De Blanke Slag**, largely intact due to Captain van Damme’s tactical restraint, coordinates with Corps des Flammes’ **Light Brigade** to encircle Legio Aeries' vulnerable rear. De Blanke Slag’s pikes and crossbows exploit openings in Legio Aeries’ flanks, driving wedges into the remaining formations.
- **Mounted Jupiter Archers** and **Gun Brigade** regroup to pour fire onto the disorganized **5th through 9th Cohorts** of Legio Aeries, finally breaking their lines and causing a rout.
- **Royal Strix Guard and Pike Infantry Brigade** charge the last of Legio Aeries' cohorts from behind. Although they succeed in routing the enemy, the heavy casualties taken by these Corps units leave their strength severely depleted.

### **7. Final Clashes and Leader Confrontations**

- **Legio Aeries’ Legatus Legionis**, seeing the situation collapse, leads a last stand with his remaining men. **Général du Corps Gérard Delacroix** personally charges into the fray, clashing with the Legatus. Both leaders sustain injuries, but Delacroix manages to cut down his opponent, sealing the victory.
- **Horation Cavalry (Right Wing)**, witnessing the fall of Legio Aeries’ leader, retreats from the battlefield, leaving the Corps des Flammes in control but battered and severely weakened.

### **8. Aftermath and Casualties**

- **Corps des Flammes** suffers devastating losses across their **Heavy Infantry Brigade**, **Magic Infantry Brigade**, and **Royal Strix Guard**. Only half of the original fighting force remains, with many injured and exhausted.
- **De Blanke Slag** emerges with minimal losses compared to the rest of the Corps, thanks to Captain van Damme’s tactical foresight. Their disciplined use of crossbows and strategic positioning protected them from the worst of the fighting.
- **Legio Aeries** is virtually annihilated, with their remaining forces either captured or retreating. The **Horation Cavalry**, while bloodied, escapes with moderate casualties, regrouping further south.
