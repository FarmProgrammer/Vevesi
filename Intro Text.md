The sickening rhythmic thud of hundreds of armoured boots marching on muddy ground reverberates through you all as you slog at the end of the line of the newly assembled [[Toscana]] army. The prince demands it in his new kingly position. Unity is necessary to [[Toscana]] for its future. Ever since his ascension 2 years ago the prince has been making strides towards it, But only since 2 months ago that Aslava was weakened by the sudden appearance of an army of undead on its Southern coastline. Jumping at the opportunity the prince assembled his mother's clan and an army of many from those under its influence and has begun subjugating many clans and homogenizing the culture. Be you in a penal legion or a general you now find yourselves in this slog through mudland to set a blank slate and a new chapter in the history of Toscana.
