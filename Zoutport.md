Zoutport is built on low land, and canals are used in addition to streets for travel within the city. It has several harbours, which are numbered from north to south. Space is precious in Zoutport, so even destroyed buildings do not stay abandoned for long before they are razed and rebuilt into something new.

The packed city of Zoutport is extremely vulnerable to fire and disease. The first large plague was over a century ago, at which point the Merchant Council banned the burial of the dead within city limits. Nevertheless, there have been other outbreaks since then, the most recent being the Queen Lady's Plague. For this reason, Zoutport has a siren exclusively for the purpose of signalling a quarantine.
