The pilgrims path is a route from [[The Southport]] that passes through [[Viphuur]] and [[Hiprax]] along the wastes, often the [[Day of the Union]] is meant to mark the arrival of the pilgrims and [[Novitates]] to [[The Grand Cathedral]]. Due to the prestige of many of the travellers [[The Church Of The Union]] often hires [[Mercenaries]] and [[Adventurers]] to guard caravans. In the journey every one of the [[Novitates]] is expected to perform 3 daily prayers to their deity as well as 5 prayers in the shrines of the towns along the path. Often these caravans are harassed by [[Corrupted Waste Dwellers]] and [[Bandits]] as they attempt to rob from the wealthier of the [[Novitates]].
In the second year of [[The Age of Strife]] the responsibility of completing the pilgrim's path falls onto the adventurer group called the [[Blue Crab Society]] led by [[Ghewoulad Rohice]].
