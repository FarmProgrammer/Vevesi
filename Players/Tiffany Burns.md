### Backstory
Tiffany never knew her parents, being left upon the steps of an orphanage in Valerius a place in Aurelia, she lived her whole life there watching the street performers do crazy explosive acts or crazy magic tricks involving smoke bombs or alchemical potions and so she got curious and wondered if SHE could do the same thing. SO she would go back to her dorm room and try to perfect her gunpowder recipe which resulted in her either burning her room causing fires to erupt or exploding pieces of furniture. She was frowned upon by her peers and the caregivers and they gave her the nickname "Tiffany Burns." because they would constantly say "Tiffany burns everything!", they treated as lesser because she would always get up to mischievous acts and dubious plans usually involving explosions. She got sick and tired of how they treated her and decided to say "SCREW THIS PLACE!." and left for the capital of Jupiter. Where she would spend a year of her life being a street urchin stealing and breaking into peoples homes for food and to survive, eventually she got caught and thrown into the dungeons/prisons of the capital where she was offered release, because she would always break out by melting/exploding the locks, they told her that she can be of use because of her knack for potions and bombs and to be apart of the Toscanan Army. So now she is a solider in Invicta 12 with her companion Mushy Snugglebites using the battlefield as her new playground.
