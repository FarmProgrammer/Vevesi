### Backstory
Tiffany never knew her parents, only thing she did know is that they never wanted her, why else would you leave a baby at the door steps of an orphanage. She figured that one out as soon as she was able to have her own stable and cohesive trains of thought. Even her own name isn’t even her own, it was thought up by the religious and pretentious caretaker, Mother Agnes, she’s the lady who rules the whole orphanage under an iron grasp, Tiffany would know, she has been beaten, bruised and held down by that grasp many times.

Tiffany was known for getting into trouble, she never saw it as her fault though. She hated being cooped up in that place and the other kids avoided her like the plague. So it’s only natural that she would get creative in her free time, after all she did manage to steal one of the sisters' lighters. That was a day Tiffany would never forget.

Tiffany was determined to enact revenge on Mother Agnes by setting her office on fire, she knew that she could siphon the oil out of a lamp and she used that to make a bigger “boom” as she calls it. Tiffany was known for doing petty pranks and minor theft and she knew she wasn’t going to get away with this one, not this time, no, this time she wanted to be caught. So she could see the anguish and horror on Mother Agnes’ face. So during the middle of the night, it happened she had done it, the fire was beautiful the embers were like fireworks being set off, the heat was intense and all Tiffany could do was stand there basking in its glory, during that moment she did a couple of things at once, it was a mixture of tears of joy and a manic ear piercing laugh that rang through the quiet halls of the orphanage. The last thing she remembers was the even hotter stare of Mother Agnes.

Tiffany nowadays doesn’t remember that night really well, all she knows is there was a lot of lashings that eventually turned into permanent scars and there was a painful burning sensation that was etched on her back forever and that mark that carved and burned into her flesh, it was the mark of the church, the mark of a heretic and she was never to set foot or go near the church or the orphanage ever again and when she awoke she found herself where they thought she belonged, in a ditch.

Tiffany during that time considered her options, she either lays there in that hole and dies or she gets out and lives to see another day. Unfortunately for Tiffany, there was no way she was getting out let alone moving, she smiled and let out one last laugh before her vision faded.

She awoke groggily noticing her surroundings, one, that she was no longer in a ditch, two, she was wrapped up in bandages and a warm blanket next to a fire, and three, there was a big man wearing funny looking clothes with a big bushy beard sitting across from her preparing what seemed like soup or a stew of sorts.

That man's name was Ivan and he saved her life. Ivan explained to Tiffany what he saw that night and decided there was no way he was gonna let her die, especially not a kid. He also mentioned that Tiffany had been out for almost a day and that she had some explaining to do. Tiffany hesitated at first, considering this could be the work of Mother Agnes, but she saw Ivan’s sympathetic eyes and couldn’t resist. She told Ivan everything, from every little detail, even the details that were too much information she told. 

After she finished, Ivan sat there for a moment, pondering on what he could say and then after a while he spoke and said to her, “Do you want to see a magic trick?” and from that day forth Tiffany and Ivan became friends. Turns out, Ivan is a street performer, full name, [[Ivan “Strong”]] 

Tiffany doesn’t know much about Ivans past, other than he’s an old bag who has lived on his own for as long as he can remember. Ivan has a knack for lifting heavy objects and being able to swallow swords and is able to produce lights from his hands and fire from his mouth. Ivan seemed to know it all. Ivan passed on those tricks to the young Tiffany, since she was very eager to help him perform.

Tiffany wanted to learn tricks or her own, she looked up to Ivan and wanted to perform with him. So she started experimenting with different kinds of components: sulfurs, belladonna, and even charcoal; hell, at one point she even used her own blood. After a long time and the help from Ivan she managed to create her own recipe for gunpowder. 

Tiffany “Burns” and Ivan “Strong”, that's what they called themselves, avid street performers gaining popularity at rather quick rates. The masses used to come and see Ivan and do his act, but now? Tiffany “Burns” comes along as this new sidekick, able to hurl bombs up into the sky that would shower the masses with confetti, juggle three bombs at once then toss them to Ivan who would punch them and make them explode into doves. People would gather around to watch as this dynamic duo pulled off their stunts, they were invited to taverns, parties, funerals, you name it! Things were finally looking up for Tiffany, after everything she had been through in her childhood, she finally felt happy and she especially loved Ivan, Who had raised her as if she was his own. Life was good.

Tiffany ran, ran so fast and never looked back. She hears Ivans’ screams and pleads for her  to run. She knew this would happen, that her past would creep up on her, that the church would come looking for their marked heretic. She doesn’t talk much about that day, what she had done to poor Ivan, he even protected her until the very end. She never saw Ivan again after that and even still remembers that warm tight embrace that he gave her, she will avenge, “The One and Only, Ivan”

Couple years pass, Tiffany now lives on the run, constantly on her toes, ducking in between different cities, towns, and homes. Dodging what she can only guess is her death. She was tired of all the running and came up with a plan. She needed somewhere safe, out of the grasp of the Shrikes. Word has it that Jupiter is going to war with the other different clans of Toscana and if they win this war, they’ll be changing and reforming a new religion, this made Tiffany smile wide, as she had an idea.
there we go
