In the depths of the marshy swamps of Ascona, where the fog clings to the twisted trees and the waters run dark and deep, there is a tale whispered by the locals—a tale of a cryptid known as the Stagroot. This creature is said to have the gnarled body of a tree, with roots and branches twisting into the form of limbs, and the decayed skull of a deer for a head. His eyes glow with an eerie green light, casting an otherworldly glow in the shadowed depths of the swamp. The Stagroot is, in reality, a fully grown Autumn mandrake. His name is Cervidus, a lonely being connected to the very heart of the swamp. As a circle of the spores druid, Cervidus possesses a deep bond with the fungi and decaying matter that thrive in the murky waters. His appearance may be fearsome, but beneath the skeletal façade lies a friendly yet curious spirit. However, nobody knows this truth about him. Cervidus has never ventured beyond the bounds of the swamp, and his interactions with the outside world have been limited to those who seek to harm his home. Poachers, loggers, and treasure hunters have all ventured into swamps of Ascona over the years, their intentions clear and destructive. To protect the fragile ecosystem he is sworn to defend, Cervidus has shown no mercy to those who threaten the swamp. His formidable appearance and his ability to manipulate the very essence of decay and growth have driven many intruders away, their tales of the fearsome Stagroot spreading through the nearby villages. The people of these villages have come to fear the Stagroot, viewing him as a vengeful spirit of the swamp. They tell stories of how he can summon swarms of spores to engulf trespassers, causing them to flee in terror or fall into a deep, dreamless sleep. They speak of how the trees themselves seem to come alive under his command, their branches twisting and reaching to ensnare those who dare to defile the swamp. Yet, the true nature of Cervidus remains a mystery. Despite his fierce defense of the swamp, he is not driven by malice but by a profound sense of duty. He tends to the delicate balance of life and death within Ascona, using his powers to nurture the plants and fungi that form the backbone of this dark and ancient ecosystem. When not defending his home, Cervidus wanders the swamp, curious about the world beyond its borders, yet cautious of the dangers it may bring. Yet never daring to venture past the borders of the swamp to the world outside. Occasionally, a lost traveler stumbles into the swamp, one who bears no ill will towards its inhabitants. To these rare souls, Cervidus may reveal himself, offering guidance and safe passage through the treacherous terrain. These encounters are rare, and those who experience them often find themselves changed, their fear replaced with a sense of awe and respect for the guardian of the Ascona Swamp. The legend of the Stagroot serves as both a warning and a lesson. It teaches the villagers that the swamp is not a place to be taken lightly, and that nature has its own protectors, fierce and unyielding. Cervidus, remains a symbol of the untamed wild, a guardian of the swamp, and a reminder that sometimes, the most fearsome creatures can also be the most misunderstood. However, Cervidus life would one day change when a group of soldiers caught in a war he knew nothing about, would come to his home to investigate the legend of the Stagroot that lived deep within the Forest and Swamps of their nearby camp. Despite the warnings from the nearby villages, fate would have them meet.
