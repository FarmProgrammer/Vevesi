2nd Light company 1st Brigade 1st infantry division
My name is Willow Calyx, and if you’re asking me to explain who I am, brace yourself. I’m a 25-year-old human with a cold, calculated rage that fuels every breath I take. I live for combat, thrive in chaos, and every ounce of my being is laced with pure hatred for this world and everyone who inhabits it. Orphaned as a child, my only inheritance was a tiny music box, a cruel relic from parents I never knew. The nuns at the orphanage despised me from the moment I could crawl. I was a troublemaker from the get-go, a girl who refused to bend and obey. Their punishment was unrelenting—beatings, scorn, and attempts to crush my spirit. Instead, they only stoked the fire within me. I reveled in the violence and chaos that followed me everywhere, my infamy spreading like a dark stain. I became the girl who lived for the fight, the one people feared. When I turned 16, their patience snapped. They threw me out onto the streets, leaving me to fend for myself. All I had was the tattered clothes on my back, a week’s worth of food, and that cursed music box. The streets were merciless, but I was a flicker of rage in the darkness. My hatred was my weapon, and it carved out a space for me in a world that had never cared about me. They called me Will O' Wisp—a name that sticks because it fits. Wisp, ghostly lights that feast on the decay and agony of their victims. I found a twisted satisfaction in it, in being a harbinger of torment. It’s a name born from fear, a fitting tribute to the destruction I leave in my wake. Then, at 18, my path intersected with Ruby Rosaura. I’d just finished dispatching a group of thieves when this beautiful, pale woman approached me. She offered me a choice: remain in the streets or come with her. I chose to follow her, and it was the best decision I ever made. Ruby belonged to one of the nine prestigious noble families of the Locked Tomb, an organization of necromancers. She needed a cavalier—a protector, someone bound to her. She needed someone with my skills and took a liking to me the first minute she saw me. For the first time in my life, someone showed me kindness and genuine interest. Ruby took me in, her family had trained me, and made me her personal cavalier. I became her shadow, a flicker of death that served her every whim. Ruby is a master of deception, presenting herself as a delicate young woman while wielding terrifying necromantic power. Her kindness is as lethal as her wrath. I adore her for it and every twisted thing she did. She’s the only person I’ve ever truly loved, and I’d die for her without hesitation. Even knowing her how ruthless she can be to her enemies and those that cross her, I stand by her, support her, and cherish every moment we share, and she genuinely trust me as I do her. But now, Ruby’s family has decided to send me away on a military mission, a move they cloaked in false necessity. Ruby protested as best she could, but they’re pushing me out to kill me, and I know it. It’s a blatant attempt to dispose of me. I see through their ploys and refuse to be discarded so easily. I’ll return, drenched in the blood of my enemies, ready to reclaim my place beside Ruby. I am a force to be reckoned with, and no one—not even those who pretend to care—will stand in my way.
