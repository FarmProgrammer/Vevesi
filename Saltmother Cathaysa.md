Basic Information: human, she/her, early 70s.

Appearance: Saltmother Cathaysa endeavors to look as much as possible like the worshippers’ image of the Sunken Harridan. She has successfully cultivated several colonies of barnacles on her body. Her eyes are glassy and clouded by cataracts and constant exposure to salt water, and she reeks of brine and dead fish. She is, in fact, human, and only around 70 years of age, but looks nothing like it.

Tone and Mannerisms: Cathaysa is consumed by her devotion to her goddess and her leadership of her flock. Her voice has been almost completely destroyed by salt water, and she alternates between slow, painful-looking hobbling and quick, jerky movements.

History and Goals: Saltmother Cathaysa has led the cult to the Sunken Harridan since anyone can remember, and has taken much joy in the attacks of the Kraken, a monster she believes was sent by the Harridan herself to bring destruction down upon those who do not worship her. She could not care less about local politics or the fate of the town, as she’s completely consumed by trying to please her goddess.

Boon: Harridan’s Help - reduces damage to buildings, increasing the town’s AC by 2.
