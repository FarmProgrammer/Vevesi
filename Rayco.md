Basic Information: human, he/him, early 50s.

Appearance: Rayco can’t be taller than 5’7”, and yet he cuts a striking figure. He has olive skin, a bushy salt-pepper beard, and a shaved head. Tattoos of waves and harpoons snake down his well-built arms and portly belly. He wears a simple white linen shirt with the sleeves rolled up and waxed canvas breeches tucked into high boots to keep the sea water away.

Tone and Mannerisms: Crass, rude, and boisterous, Rayco is a fierce believer in Cape Coral and a staunch supporter of the rebellion.

History and Goals: Rayco has been hunting whales around the Coral Shores for the better part of forty years. Rumor has it that he started sailing as a pirate, but fell in love with a woman in Cape Coral. In order to settle down with her, he abandoned the pirate’s life in favor of the marginally less dangerous life of whale hunting. Unfortunately, his beloved wife did not survive the first Kraken attack, and he’s harbored a deep resentment towards the beast ever since. His whale-hunting crew left town after the second attack, but Rayco stayed behind, determined to kill the creature and avenge his wife. He’s been designing a harpoon that could strike a decisive blow against the Kraken; now he just needs to test it out.

Boon: Whaler Turned Hunter - permanently disables one of the Kraken’s Siege Actions (one use).
