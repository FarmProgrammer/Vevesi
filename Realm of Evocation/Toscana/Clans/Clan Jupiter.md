Jupiter marching song

With wind in our wings
and wine in our glasses
Though we fall in things
our neighbors surpass us
In another we find twins
to drink wine and molasses

together we march
till the cold earth knocks
and till our bones do parch
till our heads lay on blocks
and our feather 'come starch
we shall fight on our docks
we shall fight under the arch

tomorrow is the day to die
today is the day to stand
we shall fight while we fly
we shall fight hand in hand
With wind in our wings
and wine in our glasses
[[Jupiter]]
[[Aurelia Jupiter]]
[[Marcus Jupiter]]
[[Alexander Helios]]
