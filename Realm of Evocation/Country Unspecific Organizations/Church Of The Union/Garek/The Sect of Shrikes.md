A sect of enforcers for the church of [[Garek]] that hunts heretics and judges the severity of their crimes, leading to anything from a slap on the wrist to an addition to the [[Tree Of Garek]].
The sect of shrikes has gained infamy among [[The Church Of The Union]] for its efficiency and ruthlessness.
	"If you get called heretic of all times that which you need to   fear the most is that when the moon covers the sun and dreams flow freely, just as the dreams flow so too do its servants and so too do its hunters."
