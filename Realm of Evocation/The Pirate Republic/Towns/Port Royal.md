Port royal is the seat of power for [[The Pirate Republic]] and the site upon which the [[First 10 Crews]] agreed upon the pirate code and chose to work together and defend the emerging independent countries in [[The Arrow Stones]].
Port Royal was founded on one of the larger islands within [[The Arrow Stones]] and has one of the largest ports, in size it rivals many of the largest ports in the world though it does not have much of the same organization. With the famous [[Saltblood Lighthouse]] peeking high above the ramshackle buildings of the city like the main mast of a ship, flying the jolly roger, its large stones taken from the ancient ruins that are scattered around the island. its like cutting through the mysterious outer ring of mist that surrounds the island, guiding any ships through the mist past the wrecks of many ships intent on uprooting the pirates at their source.
The island itself has 10 harbours, each names after that captain of a crew that founded the republic. The city itself is a tangled mess of buildings and markets, the smell of fish running strong through the streets and the sound of barter and chatter fill the alleys that would seem bleak to anyone who is not familiar with the jolly radiance of this island. 
Any street you walk down you are likely to find an inn serving strong rum and meals from around the world with hearty chanties welling from the stage and the patrons.
Port royal has a populatiopn of roughly 7000 people, a large number of which are not permanent residents but rather privaters waiting for the opportunity to join a pirate crew.

## Atmosphere
Port royal has an initially intimidating atmosphere with the large veil of fog one must traverse to reach it, but once there it holds a warm and welcome environ. It is mostly as one would expect of a pirate settlement, with much merriment and such. The mismatched building create a strange feeling of anything being possible in this place. The southern port is the oldest having been built by the original 10 crews with the rest of the city being tacked on as the need arose.
## Government
Port royal is one of the few towns run directly by the republic and its legislation, in some regards this is a posititive, as a lot of gernance is straightforward without the need for time to fill out forms and such, but for others it creates a somewhat greedy society, while there are laws that are upheld within the repiublic their simplicity lends itsself to them often being skirted around with different interpretations, and an occasional irregularity in how these laws are handled.

I. Every Man Shall obey civil Command; the Captain shall have one full Share and a half of all Prizes; the Master, Carpenter, Boatswain and Gunner shall have one Share and quarter.

II. If any Man shall offer to run away, or keep any Secret from the Company, he shall be marooned with one Bottle of Powder, one Bottle of Water, one small Arm, and Shot.

III. If any Man shall steal any Thing in the Company, or game, to the Value of a Piece of Eight, he shall be marooned or shot.

IV. If any time we shall meet another Marooner that Man shall sign his Articles without the Consent of our Company, shall suffer such Punishment as the Captain and Company shall think fit.

V. That Man that shall strike another whilst these Articles are in force, shall receive Mosesâ€™ Law (that is, 40 Stripes lacking one) on the bare Back.

VI. That Man that shall snap his Arms, or smoke Tobacco in the Hold, without a Cap to his Pipe, or carry a Candle lighted without a Lanthorn, shall suffer the same Punishment as in the former Article.

VII. That Man shall not keep his Arms clean, fit for an Engagement, or neglect his Business, shall be cut off from his Share, and suffer such other Punishment as the Captain and the Company shall think fit.

VIII. If any Man shall lose a Joint in time of an Engagement, shall have 400 Pieces of Eight ; if a Limb, 800.

IX. If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that Man that offers to meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer present Death.

These laws are often enforced by the people of port royal rather than any centralized enforcement, but if something truly egregious happens one of the 10 crews in charge is expected to take matter into their own hands.
## Resources
Port royal boasts a few farms, primarily orchards for fruit that is often used in the production of rum. The many docks of port royal also see large quantities of fishermen to support the population. Despite this much of the food in port royal is stolen from passing merchant ships or imported from one of the many smaller towns in [[The Arrow Stones]]. Port royal also boasts a large mine that begins at the ground floor of the saltblood lighthouse that powers its forges into producing cannonballs for the shipyards, lumber is rare on the island but no non-existent, however quality lumber often has to be stolen or imported.
