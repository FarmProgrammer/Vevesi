Basic Information: human, she/her, early 40s.

Appearance: Mama Magda has the well-built frame of someone who hoists and carries nets full of fish for a living, and the belly of someone who cooks fish for groups that never go below the double digits..

Tone and Mannerisms: Mama Magda greets everyone with a wide, welcoming grin and a motherly hug, and listens carefully to the party’s proposal before agreeing unconditionally to help. However, her maternal demeanor belies a core of grief and a spine of steel.

History and Goals: Mama Magda joined the Cape Coral revolution when she heard about the way the previous king and his family abused his bastard daughter. She agreed with the revolutionaries’ cause, but it was the mistreatment of that young girl that pushed Magda, a mother of two herself, to finally take up arms. She and her two sons swapped their nets for blades and fought in the uprising. Mama Magda became a mother figure to many of the young rebels, stitching their wounds with fishing line and covering them from enemy fire -- but while she gained many surrogate children during the fight for Cape Coral, she lost her own two sons in battle. Once the king was deposed and the child who inspired her to take up arms was freed from her torment and added to the ruling Council, Mama Magda grieved her children the only way she knew how: she took care of the town she loved nearly as much as her two boys. She continues to do so to this day, and has risen as the new guildmaster for the fishing guild. She takes her twin fishing boats, which she named for her sons, sets sail before the sun rises in the morning, and comes home with nets full of food to share every evening.

Boon: Trapping Net - limits the Kraken to two Siege Actions per round while in effect (one use).
