The sun is rising over the ocean as you enter [[Blackwater Lagoon]] for the first time, spilling like flame across the gray, choppy waters. The main street of [[Blackwater Lagoon]] runs parallel to the waterline, and is made of shells so crushed over time that they have hardened into a road. A few shops line the street, although some look to still be in the process of being built – or rebuilt. A few wooden stalls sit between the shops and the roadway proper, providing a barrier between foot traffic and passing carts. The stalls sell everything from clothing and housewares to vegetables and prepared food -- and, of course, fish -- but most of them have the look of either temporary shacks or half-rebuilt works in progress. The citizens of Cape Coral, it seems, are either in the process of reconstructing their shops or have given up entirely, knowing that the storm will come to destroy them once again no matter what.


The end of the road bends sharply away from the ocean and begins to incline toward a white stone cliff. At the top sits the [[Blackwater Castle]]: once the home of the royal family, now the seat of the City Council. The castle, made from great blocks of sandstone and the city’s signature bright [[coralite]], stands out from the white cliff below it in its colorful splendor. Depending on the time of day, the walls seem to vary in color from pink to orange, but they always give the impression that this is a place of power.

-----

	[[Princess Lua]] receives you in the Council room. Formerly the throne room of her father, the King, it is still a grand space, with high, arching ceilings and huge windows that open to the sea, but frescoes and statues depicting the royal family’s history have been replaced by simple landscapes and artisan crafts. Instead of a throne, a large, round table sits on the dais; its surface is made of polished driftwood, its legs huge branches of coral. The room’s peach-colored sandstone walls muffle the sounds and the heat from outside, despite the open windows which allow in the cool ocean breeze. A beautiful young half-orc woman sits in an unassuming rattan chair at the Council table, a half-elf in full armour standing at her shoulder.

Princess Lua welcomes provide the characters with the following information:

- Cape Coral has been harassed by a gigantic Storm on the exact same day of the month for the past 2 months. Each storm has been completely devastating, killing dozens and destroying huge swaths of the town.
- The Coral Council has been busy fortifying the wall of coralite that now serves as the city’s first and only line of defense between them and the sea, and funded a formal artillery to assist their armada in any combat, but Princess Lua still believes that this will not be enough for what she believes will come.
- Lua has been personally overseeing preparations with [[Rita]], the Captain of the Royal Armada, and [[Fernán]], Cape Coral’s artillerist. While they finish their work, she needs the party to go out into the town.
- Some of the townsfolk are attempting to make preparations on their own, while others are expecting the attack with fear and resignation or blind optimism. They need to be rallied to work together with the Princess -- and with each other.
- It’s far more important to save the lives of the citizens of Cape Coral than to protect or preserve their businesses. Buildings can be rebuilt much more easily than people can be un-killed.
- Lua suggests speaking with the following people:

	- [[Atop a Rock]], the leader of the [[Dead Mens Song]]; the kindred song may distract or disable the Kraken.
	- [[Aurum]], captain of the [[Golden Carvers]]; their pirates are formidable, cunning fighters.
	- [[Mama Magda]], the Captain of the [[Fishing Guild]], at the fishing docks; her nets are famously strong, and could slow the Kraken down.
	- [[Rayco]], a prominent whaler in [[Port Royal]], his harpoons are said to be able to hold even gods.
	- [[Saltmother Cathaysa]], the leader of the Cult of the Sunken Harridan, at their temple in [[Reek Reef]]; her goddess could protect the population.
	- The townspeople at large in the main plaza; they need to be convinced to evacuate or take shelter.

- She warns the party specifically against speaking with and getting tangled up in the research of [[Mariano]], the Royal Librarian. He’s one of the few members of the king’s court who has retained his position -- mostly because nobody is interested in taking his place. He’s been wasting his time trying to research the Kraken, believing that there’s a solution to its attacks in his books somewhere, but he hasn’t found anything in two years.

## [[Dead Mens Song]]

To the north of [[Port Royal]], past the harbor, past the docks and the last long piers, there is a long stretch of rocky beach. The waves lap gently at your feet, but the riptide is strong and cruel, tugging hard as if to pull you deeper. A few vaguely humanoid shapes in the distance turn their heads as if hearing or smelling you on the breeze, then dive quickly into the sea, swimming out only a short distance before diving deep.


Mere moments later, a head breaks the surface of the water near you, followed by a pair of powerful shoulders. A selkie regards you with large, impassive black eyes, atop the back of a massive whale.


“My kindred warned me of your approach.”


### Encounter: Trial by Combat

Long ago, the city of [[Blackwater Lagoon]] made a pact with the Merfolk kindred who resided in [[The Arrow Stones]], along this stretch of beach and underwater cave systems: the city would recognize the kindred’s sovereign independence and freedom, and in turn, the Merfolk would contribute to the city’s fishing efforts, corralling schools of fish into the city-folk’s nets and sharing the yield. They have maintained this symbiotic relationship for generations -- but the new government has not reinitiated diplomacy with the kindred to prove that they are still worthy hunt-mates. Since the party has been chosen by the princess, Atop a Rock asks them to represent her in a trial by combat. They’ll choose a number of fighters equal to the party’s numbers to make it a fair fight.

- Enemies: Atop a Rock, 2 Merfolk Bruisers, 1 Merfolk Wavesinger
- Atop a Rock will swear -- and make the player characters swear -- that the fight won’t turn deadly. He and his kindred will deal non-lethal damage, and he expects the party to do the same.
- [[Atop a Rock]] and the Merfolk Bruisers will use Pack Tactics and Atop a Rock’s Might of the Kindred trait to go on the offensive, while the Merfolk Wavesinger concentrates on support and healing from the backlines.
- Atop a Rock will forfeit when he’s the last one standing and his HP is low enough (below 20).
- If the party has maintained their agreement and has not used lethal force during combat, the kindred will heal their wounds during a Short Rest after combat, regardless of the outcome.

## [[Mariano]]

Despite the grandeur of its name, the Royal Library looks more like an enormous storage closet than a fount of knowledge. Meager shafts of sunlight peek through shuttered windows, illuminating thick motes of dust in the air. The pleasant scent of old books mingles with the ever-present smell of salt and damp that hangs over all of Cape Coral. Only a few old bookshelves, sagging with the weight of their burden, tower over a huge table in the center of the room, which itself groans under piles of manuscripts and stacks of loose papers. The sound of a scribbling quill fills the room, but it’s not until you come all the way around the table that you see its source: a small, elderly gnomish man, head bent over a sheaf of paper.

### Encounter: Skill Challenge

After more than two years of study, Mariano is convinced he’s close to a breakthrough that could help stop the Kraken. All he needs is a little more research, and a fresh perspective. The party can undergo a skill challenge to help him in his research. Have each of the players make a skill check (DC 14) to aid him. The obvious skills to use are Intelligence (Arcana, History, Nature, Investigation, or Religion), but encourage your players to come up with creative ways to help him with his research through other skills. This is an easier one: for this challenge, they need to achieve four successes before they get five failures.

We have prepared specific pieces of information that the party can glean from their research that will help you set up the reveal later on in the adventure. Give these to your players if they succeed with any of the following skills:

- Arcana: It takes enormous amounts of power to summon a Kraken, let alone control it. If the Kraken is not attacking Cape Coral of its own volition, it’s being guided by a magic-user or other being more powerful than Cape Coral has ever seen.
- History: Both the first and second attacks proceeded nearly the exact same way: the Kraken swam almost deliberately into the Cape Coral harbor, laid siege to it, destroyed roughly two thirds of the town, and then suddenly dove back into the sea and disappeared.
- Nature: Krakens do not normally attack the same place more than once. Indeed, they’re not known to leave the deepest fathoms of the ocean at all, unless driven by starvation or summoned by a powerful outside force.
- Religion: Krakens are associated with an entity known only as the Deep, a being more ancient and powerful than many gods.

If the party passes the skill challenge, Mariano gets a wild light in his eye and starts scribbling notes. He tells the party that he needs time to consolidate all of his two years’ worth of research, and dismisses them until later.
## [[Golden Carvers]]


Despite the tension in the air around you, the Merry Mermaid always bustles with life and good cheer. Several pairs of shrewd eyes follow you, though, as you climb weather-worn stairs all the way up to the third floor and knock on the door with the golden handle.


A well-dressed half-elf, bedecked in jewelry, shows you in through an apartment twice as opulent as Coral Castle itself, and into... the bathroom? The room is richly appointed, with painted tilework, gold and porcelain fixtures, and, in pride of place by the open window, a claw-footed, solid gold bathtub.


A human reclines in the tub, arms splayed out to rest on its lip and head lolled to the side in complete relaxation. They regard you with hooded eyes, gold shimmering on their lids, and a crooked smile.


“I hear you have a business... proposition for me.”

### Encounter: Trial by Combat

To convince [[Aurum]] to help, the party must first face them and their Golden Carvers in a fight; if the party is to lead the defense, they need to prove they are up to the task and that this is not a losing battle. Aurum does not take jobs that can go wrong. They pit their entire crew against the party, regardless of the party’s own numbers.

No matter who wins, Aurum will only agree to help if they are promised the spoils from the Kraken: its corpse, and any parts, pieces, and secretions it leaves behind. They plan to sell it to the northern wizards as spell components, flood the market to drive down the astronomical price until all their competitors are forced to retire, and then form a monopoly. With the right preservation methods, a Kraken’s corpse can last centuries; with the size of this one, the Golden Carvers could sell its parts for generations.

The Golden Carvers currently at the tavern are a crew of 5, plus Aurum themself. The crew is comprised of Argentum, Margarita, Carbuncle, Sapphyrus, and Cuprum, who are all Bandit Captains. If you prefer a higher challenge, consider raising the damage of Aurum’s weapon attack and change the stat blocks to be 2 Bandit Captains, 2 Veterans, and 1 Knight.  

- Enemies: Aurum, 5 Bandit Captains
- Aurum has no desire to kill the party, but does want to dispatch them quickly if they are no match for them. They will not hold back, but won’t kill any of them unless the party kills one of their crew.
- Aurum will use their blood magic to extend their survivability in combat, and they’ll make liberal use of their Cunning Action trait to weave in and out of the front lines.
- Aurum will forfeit if the party threatens to kill one of their crew or if their HP goes below 20 and they have no uses of Blood Transfusion left.
- A Golden Carver cleric will take care of Aurum’s wounds as they get back into the tub, along with the injuries of the rest of the Carvers.
- Aurum will gladly command their cleric to heal the party, too, for only 100 gold pieces per person. Anyone who agrees receives a level 2 cure wounds and a lesser restoration to cure Aurum’s poison.

## The Townspeople

Basic Information: one or two dozen humanoids of all ages and genders.

Appearance: Like most members of coastal communities, Cape Coral’s townspeople are extremely diverse, since many families only came to settle there a couple of generations ago at most. The population is largely human, although there are sizeable orc and sea elf communities. Halflings and dwarves, and their descendants, are rare in Cape Coral because of its geographical location, though not unheard of.

Tone and Mannerisms: Most of the people who speak up in discussion with the party are those who are defiant, fervent believers in their own ability to fight the Kraken. Others want to hide their heads in the sand, believing that the last attacks were coincidental and another won’t actually come.

History and Goals: The townspeople of Cape Coral are proud of their new form of government, as most remember what life was like under the now-dead king. They love their town, and they believed in its bright future after the revolution, but the last two Kraken attacks killed many and convinced some survivors to pack up and flee. Those who remain are the most passionate believers in their town -- who wish to fight and defend their home, but are not fighters, and would not be helpful in any way to the upcoming fight -- or the most deliberately ignorant optimists, who deny that more attacks will come at all.

Boon: Safe Haven - grants Cape Coral an additional 10 HP, reducing casualties.

### Encounter: Skill Challenge

The common folk of Cape Coral have no chance against the Kraken and its minions, and it’s too late to fortify the town and protect the buildings. The only solution is for the townspeople to flee, and only come back when the coast is clear. Present the party with a skill challenge: allow them to be creative in what methods, skills, and even spells they want to use to persuade the citizens. Prompt each member of the party to make one skill check (base DC 16), describing how they use that skill to convince -- or coerce -- the people of Cape Coral to flee. For example, they can use a Charisma (Persuasion) check to speak convincingly, but they could also use an Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Survival) check to explain the details of how dangerous the Kraken is.

This is a hard challenge: the players need to get four successes before they get three failures.

## [[Goldfishers]]

At the center of [[Port Royal]]’s coast lies the great, imposing harbor, where warships and trading galleons dock. To the south is the shipyard, masts proudly flying the jolly rodger. To the north, though, are the docks the humbler vessels call home. Rickety wharfs lined with little fishing-boats give way to long piers, stretching towards the horizon. There is, of course, a pervasive stink of fish, but the smell of rich spices overpowers even that.


You follow your noses to the front of the [[Goldfishers]], where a middle-aged half-orc stirs a bubbling cauldron filled with enough delicious-smelling fish stew to feed an army. She looks up as you approach, beaming in welcome.

### Skill Challenge

[[Mama Magda]] is very willing to help, and needs no convincing to stand with Princess Lua. She does need a hand putting her plan together, though. Magda is famed for her never-breaking fishing nets, and she’ll share her secret with the party: they’re made out of [[Mermaid Hair]]. No, not the actual hair of actual merfolk, but a thin, wiry substance secreted by a type of crab that lives in the coral reefs close to Cape Coral. With enough Mermaid Hair, Mama Magda could reinforce some of her nets enough to withstand even the Kraken -- and even slow it down. The only problem is that Mermaid Hair Crabs are notoriously difficult to find.

The party must dive into the waters off the shore and look for Mermaid Hair Crabs. Have each of the players make a skill check (base DC 15). They might use a Wisdom (Survival) check to find the crabs’ habitat; a Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Investigation) check to find the crabs themselves; or Wisdom (Animal Handling) or Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to acquire the Mermaid Hair. However, feel free to let your players come up with different strategies and ways to gather the hair! 

This is a medium-difficulty challenge: they must achieve four successes before they get four failures.

## The Whalers
The harbor is the heart of any port town, and Port Royall is no different. The road from the [[Pirate Haul]] leads straight through the city’s main plaza directly down to the large marina.

The biggest ship currently docked is a battered behemoth of a whaleship. Smoke pours from a furnace behind the mast, and smaller boats swing from its sides. A lone man sits on the bowsprit, a smaller plume of smoke rising from his pipe.

### Encounter: Trial Combat

[[Rayco]] wants to take revenge on the Kraken for killing his wife. He’s designed a harpoon he believes could cripple the Kraken, but he doesn’t feel comfortable putting his life in mortal danger without being sure that it does. He made a promise to his wife that he wouldn’t do anything stupid, so he’s going to test this plan’s stupidity before committing to it. He asks the party to act as a replacement for his whale-hunting crew -- or, more accurately, as bait.

The party must dive into the sea and distract Old Graybeard, an ancient, formidable whale that Rayco has been attempting to hunt for years, while Rayco uses his harpoons against it to test their efficacy. While the fight will end if the party successfully reduces Old Graybeard’s HP to zero, all they truly need to do is survive for three rounds. At the end of each round of combat, Rayco launches a harpoon from his ship, automatically hitting Old Graybeard. Once Old Graybeard has taken three harpoons, it falls to 0 HP, allowing Rayco to capture it.

## The Cult of the Sunken Harridan

South past the harbor, past the shipyard, past the docks, past all the hustle and bustle of life, a sheer cliff rises above the sea. It’s a slippery climb down to where the rocks meet the sea, and the tide is already beginning to rise as you finally stand before the mouth of Reek Reef. It laps at your heels, urging you forward into the damp, fetid darkness of the caverns.

Even within the cave system, torches guttering from the water that drips from the walls and ceilings, the way is treacherous. The slow, inevitable force of the tides have carved divots and pools into the rock floor; slick algae and seaweed grow wherever they can find purchase; and tiny sea vermin scuttle underfoot and chitter in your ears.

Finally, you find the cavern opening up before you. The damp dimness is lit only by the glow of bioluminescent algae, casting everything in an eerie blue-green light. Against the backdrop of salt-crusted stone, the shape of a humanoid, hunched and gnarled and half overtaken by barnacles, greets you.

“Who comes to grovel before the Sunken Harridan?”
### Saltmother Cathaysa

Basic Information: human, she/her, early 70s.

Appearance: Saltmother Cathaysa endeavors to look as much as possible like the worshippers’ image of the Sunken Harridan. She has successfully cultivated several colonies of barnacles on her body. Her eyes are glassy and clouded by cataracts and constant exposure to salt water, and she reeks of brine and dead fish. She is, in fact, human, and only around 70 years of age, but looks nothing like it.

Tone and Mannerisms: Cathaysa is consumed by her devotion to her goddess and her leadership of her flock. Her voice has been almost completely destroyed by salt water, and she alternates between slow, painful-looking hobbling and quick, jerky movements.

History and Goals: Saltmother Cathaysa has led the cult to the Sunken Harridan since anyone can remember, and has taken much joy in the attacks of the Kraken, a monster she believes was sent by the Harridan herself to bring destruction down upon those who do not worship her. She could not care less about local politics or the fate of the town, as she’s completely consumed by trying to please her goddess.

Boon: Harridan’s Help - reduces damage to buildings, increasing the town’s AC by 2.

Those who follow the Sunken Harridan worship the sea in its most destructive, cruel form. Many do so out of fear, but just as many follow her out of a sense of awe and deference. They see the immeasurable power of the sea as something so much greater than themselves that it simply must be worshiped. They do so by praying to the Sunken Harridan, a monstrous deity who takes the form of a woman ravaged by age and the ocean in order to remind mortals the power of the sea against their fragile bodies. Her skin is pale and blotched with purples and greens; her lips are blue and torn by crabs, crayfish, and other sea vermin; her body is bloated like a corpse left to decompose in water; she oozes salt water through barnacles that dig into her flesh. Prayer and religious rites include using the corpses of the drowned as conduits to the Harridan’s word; submerging for long periods of time in salt water until the skin shrivels and cracks to “let the sea in”; and drinking salt water to induce thirst, which they believe is a boon granted by the Sunken Harridan. Needless to say, these rituals and beliefs do not endear her worshippers to the general populace.

### Encounter: Trial by Combat

Saltmother Cathaysa will only aid Cape Coral if it is the will of her goddess. Therefore, she requires the party to undergo the Trial of the Sunken Harridan. She leads the group deep into the caves of the Reek Reef, then prays to her goddess to test them. The trial in question is a minion rush: At the start of the trial, 5 Sahuagin appear and 2 Hunter Sharks attack the party. On initiative count 20 of the third round, 5 more Sahuagin and 2 Merrows appear. On initiative count 20 of the fourth and final round, a statue of the Sunken Harridan awakens as a Gargoyle and attacks the party. At least one of the players must survive four rounds, after which all enemies dissolve into a briny puddle and the statue will return to inanimate stone.

Cathaysa does not believe for an instant that the Sunken Harridan might want to stop the Kraken, so she submits the party to trial in an effort to incapacitate them. If she succeeds in downing all of the party members, she plans to drown them as sacrifices to her goddess. If the party prevails, though, and survives the Trial, Saltmother Cathaysa deduces that the Kraken was not, in fact, sent by the Sunken Harridan, and that the goddess was in fact testing the party to see whether they were worthy of fighting alongside her worshippers against it. Upon realizing this, Cathaysa pledges wholeheartedly to lend a hand in the upcoming attack.
## Boons:
Mariano: Research - stops the Kraken entirely after 4 rounds.
Mama Magda: Trapping Net - limits the Kraken to two Siege Actions per round while in effect (one use).
Rayco: Whaler Turned Hunter - permanently disables one of the Kraken’s Siege Actions (one use).
Saltmother Cathaysa: Harridan’s Help - reduces damage to buildings, increasing the town’s AC by 2.
Townspeople: Safe Haven - grants Cape Coral an additional 10 HP, reducing casualties.
Aurum: Pirate Quartering - deals 7 (1d8+2) damage, or more if the Kraken is bloodied.
Atop a Rock: Kindred Song - imposes disadvantage on the Kraken’s attack rolls until the end of the Siege Phase.
Fernan: Artillery - deals 5 (1d4+2) damage to the Kraken.
Rita: Armada Attack - deals 7 (2d4+2) damage to the Kraken.
Pelagie: Gamblers Volley - deals 1d4 damage with exploding dice.
Claxton: The Barons Wrath - next time a character would die it is the baron but he resists it.
