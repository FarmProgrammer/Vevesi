Basic Information: human, they/them, early 30s.

Appearance: Fitting their name, Aurum is covered in gold. They have deep brown skin and jet black hair, immaculately laid in finger waves framing their face. When not in the bath, they wear high-waisted pants, mostly covered by thigh-high black leather boots that tie with leather garters to their belt; a floor-length black leather coat matches their boots, with nothing but their exposed, scarred torso underneath. The tall heels of their boots, the jewelry that drips from their ears, neck, and fingers, and the gold eyeliner perfectly applied to their lids betray a penchant for form over function that even extends to their choice of weapon. Their scimitar and cutlass have been gilded from pommel to tip, their true, deadly steel only peeking through the scuffs on the blades.

Tone and Mannerisms: Aurum is confident and cunning -- and not at all interested in hiding it from anyone who speaks to them. They draw out their words and lace them with double meaning, taking as much space as possible both with their gestures and their sheer presence. They have an exaggerated, cocky way of moving their body when they talk, and a certain performativity to all they do, but that shiny veneer is replaced with cold, hard calculation and short, cutting sentences when talking business.

History and Goals: Aurum is the latest captain of the Golden Carvers, an extremely rich pirate band that allied itself with the rebels of Cape Coral during the revolution. They took leadership of the crew in a bloody battle against the Carvers’ previous captain -- Aurum’s former lover. Rumor has it that Aurum won by turning the former captain’s blood magic against her, and that upon her death Aurum stole her power and became a Blood Thief. Aurum transformed the Bloody Carvers into the Golden Carvers, and made a series of strategic moves that filled their coffers into the fortune they hold today. Since they helped the rebels, the Golden Carvers have become a mainstay in Cape Coral, using it as their base port. Unlike most pirates, they have little interest in making a quick buck. They’ll only take jobs that pay handsomely, or that might lead to enormous profit down the line.

Boon: Pirate Quartering - deals 7 (1d8+2) damage, or more if the Kraken is bloodied.

### **TRAITS**

**Blood Purge.** Aurum has advantage on saving throws against poison.

**Evasion.** When Aurum is targeted by an effect that allows them to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, they take no damage if they succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if they fail.

**Sneak Attack (1/Turn).** Aurum deals an extra 28 (8d6) damage when they hit a target with a weapon attack and have advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Aurum that isn't incapacitated and Aurum doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

**Turn Bloody (Recharge 5-6).** When Aurum inflicts damage to a creature, they can turn the creature’s blood against it. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 17). On a failure, it takes 21 (6d6) poison damage.

### **BONUS ACTIONS**

**Blood Magic.** After Aurum deals Sneak Attack damage to a creature, they can use their bonus action to control the creature’s blood to inflict one of the following effects:

- **Blood Transfusion.** Aurum heals for an amount equal to half the damage inflicted by their Sneak Attack, rounding down.
- **Blood Stain.** The creature damaged by the Sneak Attack must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 17). On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute. It can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

This trait has 5 uses. Aurum regains all uses at the end of a long rest.

**Cunning Action.** Aurum can use a bonus action to Dash, Disengage, or Hide.

### **REACTIONS**

**Uncanny Dodge.** Aurum can use their reaction to halve the damage against them as long as they can see the creature attacking them.
