Despite its collapse [[Imperium]] was an enormously vast and powerful empire that spanned almost every plane of existence under one governing body. Due to this it is almost impossible that there would be no remnants of it after the war. As such many ruins and even small pockets of civilization that consider themselves loyal to Imperium. Though the latter are rarer they still exist, primarily in [[The Underdark]] and [[The realm of Abjuration]] which holds the largest remainder of the people of that ancient empire. Many cities in the other realms are build on ruins of ones built originally by the Imperium. Within the dense forest between [[Tulius Hills]] and the [[Aelius Steppes]] there is a fort hidden by magic within a vale, where the ancient emperor still sits protecting the last gate of access to [[The realm of Abjuration]].
