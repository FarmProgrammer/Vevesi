The haxjagere of [[Aslava]] and the feared and infamous witch hunters, trained from the age of 8 and go through gruelling training to face mages of all calibres. To this end the haxjagere are split into 11 ranks, 2 of which are only during training, this mirrors the mage ranks in [[Volska]].

## Witch hunter pledge
Before the eternal Ironwood
We show our unwavering will
upon the land i stand 
and the roots beneath it

My blood shall hence be spilt
to protect it from the vile curse of magic
that flesh tainted by it 
shall not too taint the ground

That hands tempted by it 
shall no longer move
That mouths uttering it
shall no longer speak

This sacred land is proof
That our people are strong
That our strength remains pure


## Philosophies
### 1. Samarbete
The samarbete witch hunters are the most common among the hunters and often operate in squads of 3 with a team consisting of 6 members, one squad led by a magister and the other led by a forst, each team consisting of one member from each of the sub philosophies within the larger cooperation philosophy.
#### 1. Strejk
Strejk witch hunters are those within their team who are focused on delivering decisive blows to mages, to either kill them or to facilitate their capture by the Fanga, strejk are taught the essential zones of a persons body and how to shut those down, they are known to go for essential tendons and such or for the head and heart.
#### 2. Blockera
Blockera are those taught in the ways of controlling a mage and locking them down, learning to control their movement and positioning while understanding how best to avoid and weather the blows and spells they can conjure forth.
#### 3. Fanga
A fanga can be considered similar to the Strejk but they often focus on making the life of the mage more difficult through the use of many items that interfere with their connection to the weave and its threads, while also knowing what seactions of a mage to lock down to prevent them from casting spells and to safely capture them.
### 2. Allmakt
A witch hunter that has perfect marks at their graduation as an examen is given the opportunity to undergo 2 more years of training, including field missions during which they are trained in every other philosophy to enable them to face down many mages on their own. A witch hunter that successfully completes this training can immediately be promoted to a forst.

### 4. Lard
Lard are those who have completed their second year of physical training, from this point on those who fail in further training are demoted back to this rank and will serve to complete administrative tasks and research for the organization, though many see this rank with some degree of disdain many old witchhunter who reach retirement will choose to be demoted to this position and work on researching magic and ways to counteract it.
### 5. Prefekt
Prefects are those who have successfully completed 3 years of physical training and are entering their final most gruelling year, to even reach this point is seen as a great achievement and those who fail in their final year will often choose to transfer to the regular military, often at high ranks.

### 8. Magister

### 9. Forst
A forst is the leader of a team, after exceptional service as a magister a forst can either replace a current forst or be assigned a new team to command. Alternatively if the witch hunter is trained in the Allmakt philosophy this is the rank at which they can begin to run missions alone.
### 10. Klok

### 11. Arvjägare
Arvjagare are the most feared and mysterious witch hunters, given access to knowledge considered too dangerous or ancient to any other people within aslava, knowledge even the royal family is not allowed to access, kept in a secret room beneath the witch hunter keep. There are less than a hundred witch hunters of this rank and many are undercover in high nobility of other nations, to fight a Arvjagere is to court death, it is said that even blizzards would rather dissipate than interrupt an Arvjagere and cold winds warm up to not anger them.
