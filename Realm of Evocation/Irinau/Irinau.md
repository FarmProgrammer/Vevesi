## **III. History and Lore**

- **Founding:** Before [[The Age of Discovery]] Irinau was not so much an organized country as it was a large community that was self governing, however after witnessing the colonization of [[Nassarau]] they created a organized form of government with the intent of bargaining with [[Haast]] and establishing official relations.
- **Major Events:** In [[The Age of Discovery]] Irinau avoided aggression from haast by trading [[Driftwood]] with them, the substance that allows the [[Flying Islands]] to fly.
- **Myths and Legends:** [[Vorin's Son]] is a tale about a warrior who supposedly created the flying islands from the sparks that flew from his weapon in a great war.
- **Relationship with Other Countries:** Irinau is mostly focused on technomagical advancements and has a trade deal with [[Haast]] to share its findings first with them, making them protected by [[Haast]]. It vouched for [[Inlu]] to also remain independent though [[Araluuen]] colonized it for a time. During [[The Age Of Rending]] Irinau was subjected to many raids conducted by [[Aslava]] in search of mages and to this day is suspected to have many [[Haxjagere]] spies, some also believe the remnants of [[The Nassarau Family]] reside here.

## **IV. Military and Defense**

- **Military Structure:** As part of their agreement with [[Haast]] Irinau is forbidden from having a navy, however they have a relatively well developed army, subdivided into Vedalken technomancers, and symic hybrid infantry. Their army is primarily famous for being the only country other than [[Toscana]] that has a major section of the military dedicated to air combat as some symic hybrids are outfitted with magical items that enhance their gliding capabilities to be reliable enough to fly.
- **Military Strength:** Due to their nonexistence of official navy their strength at sea is null and void, even more so since the symic hybrids capable of flight can only do so for an hour at a time before their [[Driftwood]] harness needs to be maintained by a technomancer.
- **Important Military Victories or Defeats:** Early in its history Irinau had a military campaign on its southern border against [[Araluuen]] known as [[The Rift War]], with the assistance of the [[Haast]] navy [[Araluuen]] forces consisting mostly of [[House Oberon]], [[House Titania]] and [[House Baskerville]]. 

## **V. Economy and Resources**

- **Resources:** Due to it's landmass and climate Irinau is a rich source of [[Lumber]] while simultaneously being the only country able to produce [[Driftwood]]. It also sells many [[magic items]] and trinkets
- **Industries:** Tourism is a major aspect of Irinau due to its [[Flying Islands]], as such gliding machines are often employed for tourists willing to pay. [[Driftwood]] harvesting is a closely guarded secret and must be done carefully, the most sought after job, only available to the highest of the 3 castes is that of a [[Driftwood Havester]].
- **Trade:** Irinau trades exclusively with [[Haast]].
- **Currency:** Gold coins.

## **VI. Cities and Locations**

- **Capital City:** [[Straxsea]] is the capital of Irinau and its seat of power, it is known for it's [[Haast]] embassy and its  unusual construction among various smaller [[Flying Islands]] that often serve as divisions for districts of the city.
- **Other Important Locations:** [[Ilario]], [[Osatol]] and [[Xocrith]] are the main producers of [[Driftwood]] and are built intentionally to be less enticing to tourists so as to attract less of them. [[Srison]] is one of the few cities built on a flying island over [[Eiric's Sweat]] lending itself to amazing views and [[Skyclaw Palace]] in [[Crotin]] is a castle where each spire is built on an individual island reaching into the heavens with [[Whitestone]] bridges connecting them, this was built intentionally as a tourist attraction but was marketed as ancient.
