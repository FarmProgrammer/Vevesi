The first creation of [[The Weave]] the allmaker is an unimaginably powerful entity that shaped the realms as they are today and in the many iterations that preceded this one. However, the allmaker is cursed by the weave, for despite its immense power it is almost childlike in its regard for its creations, watching them for a time and then growing bored and wanting to rebuild, like a child with wooden blocks, due to this the weave cursed it, to be unable to directly intervene with any of its creations. Because of that the allmaker makes flaws in every world they touch, making them fundamentally timed bombs that will eventually destroy themselves, this is the cause for the fall of [[Veritas]], [[Vorus]], [[Felicity]] and [[Nihilus]]. The current world suffers from [[The 14 Flaws]].
