Basic Information: merfolk (selkie), he/him, unknown age.

Appearance: Atop a Rock has an almost alien appearance, with an unearthly beauty and grandeur. His build is largely humanoid, but clearly adapted to life underwater, with broad, sloping shoulders that reduce drag while swimming; long, muscular arms that end in long, webbed fingers; extremely developed pectoral muscles; and a long torso that gives way to a tail similar to the lower half of a sea lion. His hair is long, silvery, and mottled like the fur on his body, with a coarse texture more like the hide of a beast than a humanoid’s hair. His eyes are wide-set and large, his nose snout-like, and his lips thin and black.

Tone and Mannerisms: Atop a Rock’s speech is measured, calm, and deliberate; as the only member of his kindred who can speak Common, he’s used to dealing with land-dwellers.

History and Goals: As the leader of the Merfolk kindred, Atop a Rock’s only goal is to keep his people safe and thriving. He does not count his age in years, but he has led his people for countless tides. His name might seem strange to above-sea cultures, but every member of Atop a Rock’s kindred is named after the place where they were spawned. In the Merfolk’s own language, these names are easy and fast to say, but they can get unwieldy when translated to the common tongue -- for example, the previous leader of the kindred was named Under the Dead Portion of the Coral Reef.

Boon: Kindred Song - imposes disadvantage on the Kraken’s attack rolls until the end of the Siege Phase.
