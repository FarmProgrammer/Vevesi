While the most well known are those owned by the members of the [[Merchant Council]] the greed and ambition of the people of Haast have led to innumerable individuals and families founding and running smaller trade companies, perhaps caravans on one of the larger continents or a small fleet or single ship that runs from port to port seeking to sell wares, it is to facilitate these that [[Haast]] prints and distributes the [[Daily Trade Overview]] that lists supply and demand in every major port in the world.
	"Just as sailor view compasses and farmers survey grain the prudent trader would do well to survey the publication of the trader's holy book, or as it is known, the [[Daily Trade Overview]]".
		[[Kees Henk]], in [[The Trader's Plan to Success]].
Every major port within a country that is not actively hostile towards [[Haast]] has an [[Exchange]], a building made to help the trade of large cargo and to keep track of the4 amount of major trade resources incoming and their value according to current scarcity.
